 edgar allan poe was born in boston  on 
the    th of january        he was named 
allan after a wealthy and intimate friend of 
the family  and when both his parents died his 
godfather  who  although long married  was 
childless  adopted the little orphan  then only 
six years old  even at this early age poe was 
noted for his precocity as well as for his 
beauty  and mr  allan appears to have been 
extremely proud of his youthful protege  and 
to have treated him in many respects as his 
own son  the boy is stated to hav e been 
made quite a show child of by his adopted 
father  a tenacious memory and a musical ear  
we are informed  enabling him to learn by 
rote  and declaim to the evening visitors 
assembled at mr  allan s house  the finest pas  
sages of english poetry with great effect  
 the justness of his emphasis  and his evident 
appreciation of the poems he recited   we 
learn  made a striking impression upon his 
audience   while every heart was won by the 
ingenuous simplicity and agreeable manner of 
the pretty little elocutionist   gratifying as 
these exibitions may have been to his god  
father s vanity  the probable consequence of 
such a system of recurring excitements upon 
the boy s morbidly nervous organization could 
scarcely fail to be disastrous  indeed  in after 

  



  memoir  

years  the poet bitterly bewailed the pernicious 
effects of his childhood s misdirected aims    i 
am   he but too truthfully declared   the 
descendant of a race whose  imaginative and 
easily excitable temperament has at all times 
rendered them remarkable  and in my earliest 
infancy i gave evidence of having fully inher  
ited the family character  as i advanced in 
years it was more strongly developed  becom  
ing  for many reasons  a cause of serious dis  
quietude to my friends  and of positive injury 
to myself        my voice was a household 
law  and  at an age when few children have 
abandoned their leading strings  i was left to 
the guidance of my own will  and became  in 
all but name  the master of my own actions   
in       the allans having to visit england 
on matters connected with the disposal of some 
property there  brought their adopted son with 
them  and after taking him on a tour through 
england and scotland with them  left him at 
the manor  house school in church street  
stoke newington  the school belonged to a 
rev  dr  bransby  who is so quaintly described 
in  william wilson   one of poe s finest sto  
ries  at the time of poe s residence the school 
grounds occupied a large area  but of late years 
they have been greatly circumscribed in extent  
the description of the place  and the account 
of his life there  poe is stated to have declared 
were autobiographical  y portrayed in this tale  
if so  a portion of  william wilson s   oft  
quoted reminiscences must be relegated to the 
exaggerated memories of childhood  in some 



memoir    

respects the description of the  large  rambling 
elizabethan house  corresponds more closely 
to the fine old manorial residence facing the 
school  but in others the place is described 
with almost pre raphaelite minuteness  the 
picture of stoke newington as it was when 
poe resided there is also unusually accurate in 
its details  friendless and orphaned though 
he was  it was probably the happiest portion of 
his life that the future poet passed in this con  
genial spot  this  misty looking village of eng  
land  where were a vast number of gigantic 
and gnarled trees  and where all the houses 
were excessively ancient    in truth   adds 
poe   it was a dream like and spirit soothing 
place  that venerable old town   and it is not 
strange that the boy s plastic mind should have 
received  and retained indelibly imprinted 
upon it the impression of  and in after years 
recall  in fancy   the refreshing chillness of its 
deeply shadowed avenues  inhale the fragrance 
of its thousand shrubberies  and thrill anew 
with undefinable delight  at the deep hollow 
note of the church bell  breaking each hour 
with sudden and sullen roar  upon the still  
ness of the dusky atmosphere in which the 
fretted gothic steeple lay imbedded and 
asleep   

here  in this dreamy place  edgar poe spent 
from four to five years of his existence  and  
notwithstanding the monotony of school  ife  
was doubtless fully justified in looking back 
upon the days passed in that venerable acad  
emy with pleasurable feelings   the teeming 



    memoir  

brain of childhood   to quote his own words  
   requires no external world of incident to 
occupy or amuse it        the morning s awak  
ening  the nightly summons to bed  the con  
nings  the recitations  the periodical half holi  
days and perambulations  the play ground  
with its broils  its pastimes  its intrigues   
these  by a mental sorcery long forgotten  
were made to involve a wilderness of sensation  
a world of rich incident  a universe of varied 
emotion  of excitement  the most passionate 
and spirit stirring   oh  le bon temps  que ce 
siecle de ferf   

the house was  indeed still is  as poe 
described it   old and irregular    the 
grounds   he continues   were extensive  and 
a high and solid brick wall  topped with a bed 
of mortar and broken glass  encompassed the 
whole  this prison like rampart formed the 
limit of our domain   beyond it we saw but 
thrice a week once every saturday afternoon  
when  attended by two ushers  we were per  
mitted to take brief walks in a body through 
some of the neighboring fields  and twice dur  
ing sunday  when we were paraded in the same 
formal manner to the morning and evening 
services in the one church of the village        
at an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a 
more ponderous gate  it was riveted and 
studded with iron bolts  and surmounted with 
jagged iron spikes    tfliat impressions of deep 
awe did it inspire        the extensive en  
closure was irregular in form  having many 
capricious recesses  of these  three or four of 



memoir    

the largest constituted the play ground  it 
was level  and covered with fine  hard gravel  
i well remember it had no trees  nor benches  
nor anything similar  within it  ot course it 
was in the rear of the house  in front lay a 
small parterre  planted with box and other 
shrubs  but through this sacred division we 
passed only upon rare occasions indeed such 
as a first advent to school  or final departure 
thence  or perhaps when a parent or friend 
having called for us we joyfully took our way 
home for the christmas or midsummer holi  
days      

 the ardor  the enthusiasm  and the imper  
iousness    which is declared to have rendered 
the soi disant   william wilson  a marked 
character amongst his school mates  so that by 
slow but natural gradations he obtained an 
ascendency over all  not greatly older than him  
self  may be safely assumed to represent poe s 
own character  even at this early epoch of his 
life  as it is invariably found to represent it from 
first to last  undoubtedly it was in this  ven  
erable academy  that our poet acquired the 
groundwork of that curious superstructure of 
classic lore which in after years was one of the 
chief ornaments of his weird and wonderful 
works  to the lustrum of his life spent in 
england  edgar poe was probably far more 
scholastically indebted than the world can or 
will ever know

   memoir  

mr  allan would seem to have been very 
proud of his handsome and precocious godson  
and always to have been willing to afford him 
any amount of education procurable   but of 
parental love  of that deep sympathy for which 
the poor orphan yearned  he seems to have 
been utterly devoid  not but what the impe  
rious little fellow was indulged in what money 
could purchase  but the petting and spoiling 
which he still appears to have received was not 
of that kind to touch his tender heart  
throughout life a morbid sensitiveness to 
affection was one of his most distinguishing 
traits  and this it was that frequently drove 
him to seek in the society of dumb creatures 
that love which was denied him  or which he 
sometimes believed denied him  by human 
beings  there is a paragraph in his terrible 
tale ot  the black cat   which those who were 
intimately acquainted with poe will at once 
recognize the autobiographical fidelity of  
  from my infancy    he remarks   i was noted 
for the docility and humanity of my disposi  
tion  my tenderness of heart was even so 
conspicuous as to make me the jest of my 
companions  i was especially fond of ani  
mals  and was indulged by my parents with a 
great variety of pets  with these i spent 
most of my time and never was so happy as 
when feeding and caressing them  this pecu  
liarity of character grew with my growth  and 
in my manhood i derived from it one of my 
principal sources of pleasure  to those who 
have cherished an affection for a faithful and 



memoir  ii 

sagacious dog  i need hardly be at the trouble 
of explaining the nature or the intensity of 
the gratification thus derivable  there is 
something in the unsel fish self sacrificing 
love of a brute which goes directly to the heart 
of him who has had frequent occasion to test 
the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of 
mere man      

in her before quoted little book mrs  whit  
man relates a well authenticated and charac  
teristic anecdote of poe when he was studying 
at the richmond academy  and whilst it very 
strikingly illustrates the almost quixotic con  
stancy of his attachments his gratitude for 
kindness it also but too clearly demonstrates 
how little sympathy and affection the young 
orphan received from his adopted parents  
   he one day accompanied a schoolmate to his 
home   relates mrs  whitman     where he saw 

for the first time mrs  h s    the mother 

of his young friend  this lady  on entering 
the room  took his hand and spoke some gentle 
and gracious words of welcome which so pen  
etrated the sensitive heart of the orphan boy 
as to deprive him of the power of speech  and 
for a time almost of consciousness itself  he 
returned home in a dream  with but one 
thought  one hope in life to hear again the 
sweet and gracious words that had made the 
desolate world so beautiful to him  and filled 
his lonely heart with the oppression of a new 
joy  this lady afterward became the confi  
dent of all his boyish sorrows  and hers was 

 mrs  helen stannard was the name of this lady  



   memoir  

the one redeeming influence that saved and 
guided him in the earlier days of his turbulent 
and passionate youth   but  alas for the poor 
lad  this lady was herself overwhelmed with 
fearful and peculiar sorrows  and at the very 
moment when her guiding voice was most 
needed  she died  but when she was entombed 
in the neighboring cemetery  her poor boyish 
admirer could not endure the thought of her 
lying there lonely and forsaken in her vaulted 
home  and for months after her decease  
like his contemporary petofi  the great hun  
garian poet  at the grave of his girl love 
etelka  poe would go nightly to visit the tomb 
of his revered friend  and  when the nights 
were very dreary and cold  when the autumnal 
rains fell  and the winds wailed mournfully 
over the graves  he lingered longest and came 
away most regretfully    

for years  if not  for life  the memory of this 
unfortunate lady tinged all his fancies and 
filled his mind with saddening things  in a 
letter written within a twelve month of his 
death to the truest friend  in all probability  of 
his  lonesome latter years   poe broke though 
his usual reticence as to his early life  and con  
fessed that his exquisite stanzas   helen  thy 
beauty is to me   were inspired by the mem  
ory of this lady  by  the one idolatrous and 
purely ideal love  of his tempest tossed boy  
hood  in the earliest versions of his boy  
hood s poems the name helen frequently 
recurs  and it was undoubtedly to her that he 
inscribed  the paean   a juvenile poem  



memoir     

which he subsequently greatly improved both 
in rhythm and expression  and republished 
under the musical name of  lenore   the 
description which poe afterward gave to a 
friend of the fantasies that haunted his brain 
during  his desolate vigils in the cemetery  the 
namtless fears and indescribable phantasms  

 flapping from out their condor wings 
invisible woe   

she compares to those which overwhelmed de 
quincey at the burial of his sweet sister and 
playmate  we linger somewhat over this 
little known epoch of poe s story  because we 
are perfectly convinced that mrs  whitman has 
indeed found  a key to much that seems 
strange and abnormal in the poet s after life  
in those solitary churchyard vigils with all 
their associated memories   there can in  
deed be no doubt that those who would seek 
the clue to the psychological phenomena of his 
strange existence  that intellect as poe him  
self said which would try to reduce his  phan  
tasm to the commonplace   must know and 
even study this phase of his being  the mind 
which could so steadfastly trace  step by step  
the terrible stages of sentence after death  as 
edgar poe s does in his weird  colloquy of 
monos and una   must  indeed  have been 
one that frequently had sought to wrest from 
the charnel house its earthy secrets  

returning to the more commonplace records 
fcf his history  the future poet is described to  
us at this period of his life as remarkable 



u memoir  

j 

for his general cleverness  his feats of activity  
his wayward temper  his extreme personal 
beauty  and his power of extemporaneous tale    
telling  and  even at this early stage  as a 
great classical scholar  and as well versed in 
mathematics  botany  and other branches of 
the natural sciences  it is but just that we 
should refer to griswold s account of his epoch 
in the life of edgar poe  as that biographist s 
mendacity is not known to all  

 in        says griswold  c  poe returned to 
the united states  and after passing a few 
months at an academy in richmond  he en  
tered the university at charlottesville  where 
he led a very dissipated life  the manners 
which then prevailed there were extremely 
dissolute  and he was known as the wildest 
and most reckless student ot his class         
he would have graduated with the highest 
honors had not his gambling  intemperance  
and other vices induced his expulsion from the 
university   the mere fact that  according 
to griswold s dates  poe would only have been 
at this time in the eleventh or twelfth year of 
his age  is sufficient to induce doubt as to the 
correctness of his accusations  but  fortunately 
for the fair fame of the accused  indisputable 
evidence as to the entire untruth of griswold s 
story has been procured  on may           
dr  stephen maupin  president of the univer  
sity of virginia  in answer to various inquiries 
made of him relative to edgar poe s career at 
charlottesville  procured a statement from 
mr  william wertenbaker  secretary of the 



memoir     

faculty  which he further indorsed with the 
remark that  mr  wertenbaker s statement is 
worthy of entire confidence    i may add   
he continues   that there is nothing on the 
faculty records to the prejudice of mr  poe  
he appears to have been a successful student  
having obtained distinctions in latin and 
french at the closing examinations of       
he never graduated here  no provision for 
conferring degrees of any kind having been 
made at the time he was a student here   dr  
maupin s letter is followed by the said state  
ment  and a most interesting as well as con  
clusive document it is  says mr  werten  
baker   

 edgar a  poe was a student of the university of 
virginia during the second session  which commenced 
february i        and terminated december i$th of the 
same year  he signed the matriculation book on the 
i th of february  and remained in good standing as a 
student till the session closed  he was born on the igth 
of february        being a little under seventeen when 
he entered the institution  he belonged to the schools 
of ancient and modern languages  and as i was myself 
a member of the latter  i can testify that he was toler  
ably regular in attendance  and a very successful stu  
dent  having obtained distinction in it at the final exam  
ination  the highest honor a student could then obtain  
the present regulation in regard to degrees not having 
been at the time adopted  on one occasion professor 
blatterman requested his italian class to render into 
english verse a portion of the lesson in tasso  assigned 
for the next lecture  mr  poe was the only one who 
complied with the request  he was highly compli  
mented by the professor for his performance  

 although i had a passing acquaintance with mr  poe 
from an early period of the session  it was not until near 
its close that i had any social intercourse with him  



   memoir  

after spending an evening together at a private house  
he invited me to his room  it was a cold night in de  
cember  and his fire having gone nearly out  by the aid 
of some candle ends and the wreck of a table  he soon 
rekindled it  and by its comfortable blaze i spent a very 
pleasant hour with him  on this occasion he spoke 
with regret of the amount of money he had wasted  and 
the debts he had contracted  in a biographical sketch 
of mr  poe  i have seen it stated that he was at one 
time expelled from the university   but that he after  
ward returned and graduated with the highest honors  
this is entirely a mistake  he spent but one session 
at the university  and at no time did he fall under the 
censure of the faculty  he was not at that time ad  
dieted to drinking  but had an ungovernable passion for 
card playing  mr  poe was several years older than 
his biographer represents him  his age    have no 
doubt  was correctly entered on the matriculation 
book   

so much for the story started  or at all 
events promulgated by griswold  of edgar 
poe s expulsion from the university  this 
writer admits that poe was noted at this time 
for feats of hardihood  strength  and activity  
and recounts but with his usual exaggera  
tion an aquatic performance of the lad s  on 
a hot day of june  according to poe s own 
statement  he swam from ludlum s wharf to 
warwick    distance of six miles  against a 
strong tide   and when the truth of the asser  
tion was publicly questioned  he obtained a 
certification of the fact from several compan  
ions  including his dear classmate  robert 
stannard  this document  moreover  declares 
that  mr  poe did not seem at all fatigued  
and walked back to richmond immediately 
after the feat  which was undertaken for a 



memoir  i  

wager    our poet had  indeed  no little con  
fidence in his swimming powers  and asserted 
that  on a favorable day  he believed he could 
swim the english channel from dover to 
calais  

in       aroused by the heroic efforts the 
greeks were making to throw off the yoke of 
their turkish oppressors  and  doubtless  emu  
lous of byron  whose example had excited the 
chivalric boys of both continents  edgar poe 
and an acquaintance  ebenezer burling  deter  
mined to start for greece and offer their aid to 
the insurgents  either mr  burling s heart 
failed  or parental authority was too strong for 
him  for he stayed at home  whilst the embryo 
poet  doubtless in headstrong opposition to the 
wishes of his adopted parents  started alone 
for europe  poe was absent for more than a 
year  but the adventures of his journey have 
never been told   he seems to have been very 
reticent upon the subject  and to have left un  
contradicted the various stories invented  and 
even published during his lifetime  to account 
for the interregnum in his history  that he 
reached england is probable  but whether he 
ever beheld  save in his  mind s eye   the 
remains of 

 the glory that was greece 
and the grandeur that was rome   

is still uncertain   there are a few slight allus  
ions scattered amid his writings to the scenery 
of both greece and italy  but it is impossible 
to found anything reliable upon such data  



   memoir  

the story as to his having arrived at st  peters  
burg  and got involved in difficulties that nec  
essitated ministerial aid to extricate hhn  must 
be given up  as must also that founded upon 
the suggestion made by the anonymous author 
of a scurrilous paper which appeared in the 
southern literary messenger  that poe  when 
in london  formed the acquaintance of leigh 
hunt and theodore hook  and lived like 
 that class of men       dragging out a preca  
rious existence in garrets  doing drudgery 
work  writing for the great presses and for the 
reviews  whose world wide celebrity has been 
the fruit of such men s labor   

in      edgar poe returned home if mr  
allan s residence may so be termed  he 
reached richmond  virginia  we have been 
informed  early in march  but too late to take 
a last farewell of his adopted mother  she 
having died on the ayth of february  and her 
funeral having taken place the very day before 
poe s return  mrs  allan had probably exer  
cised a conciliatory influence in the household  
where  we hear  it was frequently needed  and 
the poor lad  who in after life invariably spoke 
well of this lady  doubtless soon felt the effects 
of her loss  mr  allan does not appear to have 
manifested any great pleasure at the prodigal s 
return  but when poe expressed his willing  
ness to devote himself to the military profes  
sion  he exercised his influence and obtained a 
nomination for him to a scholarship in the 
military academy at west point  as  accord  
ing to the rules of that institution  appoint  



memoir     

ments are not given to candidates after they 
have attained their twenty first birthday  the 
young   author  for such he now was  was only 
just in time to secure his nomination  mean  
while  poe had published a little volume of 
poems  his first known essay in literature  
under the title of  al aaraaf  temerlane  and 
other poems   lowell and others of the 
poet s reviewers speak of an earlier edition of 
this book as published in       and from it the 
delicate little lyric   to helen   is professedly 
extracted  this      volume is also stated to 
have received very flattering notice from the 
veteran author  john neal  but it has disap  
peared without leaving any trace  and the 
edition ot       which was printed for private 
circulation only  is the earliest discoverable 
vestige of poe s literary powers  

reverting to the military academy  the 
records show that poe was admitted into that 
institution as a cadet on the ist of july        
he is declared to have entered upon his new 
mode of living with customary energy  but 
very speedily discovered how totally unsuited 
to him now was the strict discipline and mo  
notonous training of such a place as west 
point  the wayward and erratic course of 
existence to which he had been accustomed  
together with his having been for so long a 
time sole master of his own actions  rendered 
it impossible for him to submit to the galling 
restraints of this institution  a fellow cadet 
with him at the academy informs us of  his 
utter inefficiency and state of abstractedness 



   memoir  

at that place  he could not  or would not  
he remarks   follow its mathematical require 
ments  his mind was off from the matter of 
fact routine of the drill  which in such a case 
as his  seemed practical joking on some ethe  
real visionary expedition  he was marked   
adds our informant   for an early death   
this institution was utterly unsuitable for 
one of poe s temperament and experience   it 
was a repetition of the old story of pegasus at 
the plow  and the climax was  as could easily 
have been foreseen  that on the yth of jan  
uary        he was tried by a general court  
martial  for various neglects of duty and diso  
bedience of orders   to which he could but 
plead guilty  and  he was  on the subsequent 
 th of march   dismissed the service of the 
united states   

in       whilst still cadet  and all unawed 
by the sentence impending  he published an 
enlarged collection of his boyish rhymes under 
the title of  poems by edgar a  poe   this 
volume  garnished with a quotation from 
rochefoucauld   tout le monde a raison  and 
which  like its predecessors  was for private 
circulation  was dedicated to  the united 
states corps of cadets   a dedication which 
appears to have drawn upon its unfortunate 
author the ridicule of his fellow students  a 
fellow cadet  a general cullum  alluding to the 
contents of this little volume  says   these 
verses were the source of great merriment 
with us boys  who considered the author 
cracked and the verses ridiculous doggerel    



memoir     

happily for literature  the opinion of    us boys    
did not carry much weight  and poe continued 
to write  verses  quite regardless of west 
point and its judgments  this little book is 
most interesting not only on account of its 
cleverly written prefatory letter of seventeen 

pages  addressed to a certain mythical  b   

but also from the fact that it contains a large 
quantity of verse suppressed in later editions 
of poe s works  the prose is followed by a 
poetical introduction of sixty six lines  a por  
tion of which  under the title of  romance   
is included in the general collection of 
 poems written in youth   many of the 
omitted portions of this volume have a strange 
biographical interest for those conversant with 
the true story of edgar poe s life  to them 
they hint of something more than mere 
rhymes  the omissions from it are as happy as 
the additions to those boyish poems  no re  
gard for the relics of his youth withheld edgar 
poe in after life from pruning away the ex  
crescences of his juvenile verse  the critic s 
unswerving hand clipped or molded all into 
artistic unity  

upon leaving west point  poe returned to 
mr  allan s residence at richmond  and 
appears to have remained there some time on 
sufferance  soon after his return home he be  
came attached to miss royster  and was ulti  
mately  it is believed  engaged to her  mr  
allan  why it is not known  was violently 
opposed to the match  and without his pecuni  
ary aid  matrimony was out of the question  as 



   memoir  

poe was entirely dependent upon him  a vio  
lent quarrel took place between the old man 
and his adopted son  and poe  unable to sub  
mit calmly to the course of events  again left 
home  this time with the intention of proceed  
ing to poland  to expend his energies in aiding 
the poles in their struggles against russia  
how far he got is not known  but it is sup  
posed that he did not leave america  having 
been stopped by the intelligence that  on the 
 th of september  warsaw had fallen  carry  
ing with it the last hopes of the polish insur  
gents  in the meanv hile  as if to widen the 
estrangement at home  mr  allan had taken 
unto himself a young wife  the beautiful 
miss paterson  whilst miss royster  forgetful 
of her faith  was married to a wealthy man  a 
mr  shelton  once more aimless  and prob  
ably resourceless  the chivalric young poet 
again sought his native province  whether 
he returned to the home that was home no 
more is uncertain  but  from what is known of 
his proud spirit  it seems unlikely  if he did  
however  his stay was of short duration  and 
his godfather s second wife having given birth 
to a son was the death blow to poe s prospects 
of succeeding to the property  

bankrupt in nearly everything  the unfortu  
nate poet now turned to literature as a means 
of obtaining subsistence  but he found the 
waters of helicon were anything but pactolian  
where he wandered  and what he did  for 
nearly two years  still remains  an unraveled 
mystery  but it is alleged that some of his fin  



memoir     

est stories were written during this epoch  and  
although accepted and published by magazine 
editors  were scarcely ever paid for  in      
he is heard of in baltimore competing for 
prizes offered by the proprietor of the satur  
day visitor for the best prose story and the 
best poem  here  then  was an opportunity 
of deferring  for a while at least  the starva  
tion which was not far off  for the competi  
tion  poe selected and sent in six of his stories  
and his poem of  the coliseum    some 
v ell known literary men consented to adjudi  
cate upon the mass of papers received  and 
after a careful consideration of the various 
contributions  decided unanimously that poe  
who was unknown to them  was entitled to 
both premiums  

not contented with this award  the adjudi  
cators even went out of their way to draw up 
and publish the following flattering critique on 
the merits of the writings submitted by poe  

 amongst the prose articles were many of various 
and distinguished merit  but the singular force and 
beauty of those sent by the author of  the tales of the 
folio club   leave us no room for hesitation in that de  
partment  we have accordingly awarded the premium 
to a tale entitled the  ms  found in a bottle   it would 
hardly be doing justice to the writer of this collection to 
say that the tale we have chosen is the best of the six 
offered by him  we cannot refrain from saying that the 
author owes it to his own reputation  as well as to the 
gratification of the community to publish the entire vol  
ume   tales of the folio club    these tales are emi  
nently distinguished by a wild  vigorous  and poetical 



   memoir  

imagination  a rich style  a fertile invention  and varied 

and curious learning  

 john p  kennedy  
 j  h  b  latrobe  and 
 james h  miller   

griswold tells the story of the award thus   

 such matters are usually disposed of in a very off  
hand way  committees to award literary prizes drink 
to the payer s health in good wines over unexamined 
mss   which they submit to the discretion of publishers  
with permission to use their names in such a way as to 
promote the publisher s advantage  so  perhaps  it 
would have been in this case  but that one of the com  
mittee taking up a little book remarkably beautiful and 
distinct in calligraphy  was tempted to read several 
pages  and becoming interested  he summoned the 
attention of the company to the half dozen compositions 
it contained  it wa unanimously decided that the 
prizes should be p d to  the first of the geniuses who 
had written legibly   not another ms  was unfolded  
immediately the  con dential envelope  was opened  
and the successful competitor was found to bear the 
scarcely known name of poe   

the above report  which was published on 
the    th of october        is of itself a com  
plete disproof of griswold s dishonoring accu  
sation against the committee of having awarded 
the prizes to poe because of his beautiful hand  
writing  without looking at a single ms  of 
any other competitor  when the story  it may 
be added  was brought to the notice of mr  
latrobe and the honorable john p  kennedy   
the two surviving adjudicators  they at once 
denied its truth  

mr  kennedy  the well known author  was 
so interested in the successful but unknown 



memoir     

competitor  that he invited him to his house  
and poe s response  written in his usual 
beautiful and distinct caligrnphy  proves the 
depth of misery to which he had sunk  how 
his heart bled to pen these lines few can prob  
ably imagine  

 your invitation to dinner has wounded me 
to the quick  i cannot come for reasons of 
the most humiliating nature my personal 
appearance  you may imagine my mortifica  
tion in making this disclosure to you  but it is 
necessary   

urged by the noblest feelings  mr  kennedy 
at once sought out the unfortunate youth  and 
found him  as he declares  almost starving  
poe s wretched condition inspired the unselfish 
author with pity  as his genius did with admi  
ration  and from henceforth he became his 
firm friend  it is interesting to learn that to 
the last poe retained his benefactor s friend  
ship and respect  as mr  kennedy acknowl  
edged when informed of the poet s decease  
and no better disproof of the calumnies heaped 
by griswold on the dead man s head could be 
given  than by repeating the testimonies of all 
those with whom poe lived and labored  so 
far from contenting himself with mere cour  
tesies  mr  kennedy assisted his new protegg 
to re establish himself in the outward garb of 
respectability  and in many respects treated 
him more like a dear relative than a chance 
acquaintance  in his diary he records   i 
gave him clothing  free access to my table  and 
the use of a horse for exercise whenever he 



   memoir  

chose  in fact  brought him up from the very 
verge of despair      aided by such a friend  
poe s affairs could not but mend  

in the spring of       mr  allan died  and if 
his god son still retained any expectations of 
inheriting any portion of his wealth he was at 
last undeceived  as  in the language of gris  
wold   not a mill was bequeathed to poe   
in august of this same year  a mr  white  an 
energetic and accomplished man  in opposition 
to the advice of his friends  commenced the 
publication of the southern literary messen  
ger  in richmond  virginia  this magazine 
was a very daring speculation at such a time 
and place  and but for a fortunate accident 
might have placed its promoter completely 
hors de combat  amongst the well known writ  
ers whose aid he solicited was mr  kennedy  
and he  being fully engaged  advised poe to 
send something  our poet did so  and mr  
white  greatly pleased with his contributions  
spoke of them in very flattering terms  in 
march        publishing  berenice    hence  
forth poe became a regular monthly contribu  
tor to the messenger  mr  kennedy had now 
had a year and a half s experience of poe  
without finding anything in his conduct to 
alter the good opinion he had formed of him  
and the following letter is quoted by griswold 
as having been written at this period by mr  
kennedy to mr  white  as it is apparently 
authentic  we quote it  



 dear sir  



 baltimore  april           
 poe did right in referring to me  he i 



memoir     

very clever with his pen classical and scholarlike  he 
wants experience and direction  but i have no doubt he 
can be made very useful to you  and  poor fellow   he 
is very poor  i told him to write something for every 
number of your magazine  and that you might find it to 

s ur advantage to give him some permanent employ  
e has a volume of very bizarre tales in the hands of 

  in philadelphia  who for a year past has been 

promising to publish them  this young fellow is highly 
imaginative  and a little given to the terrific  he is at 
work upon a tragedy  but i have turned him  to drudg  
ing upon whatever may make money  and i have no 
doubt you and he will find your account in each other   

mr  white undoubtedly found his  account  
in his new contributor  and every month 
called the attention of his readers to the 
beauties of the current tale by the young 
author  

in the june number of the magazine ap  
peared poe s tale of  hans pfaall   and three 
weeks later there appeared in the new york 
sun  mr  locke s famous  moon hoax  story  
griswold alludes to the former being  in some 
respects very similar to mr  locke s celebrated 
account   in a way to make his readers be  
lieve our poet the copier instead of the copied  
poe s reputation was now increasing so rapidly 
that mr  white became desirous of retaining 
his services exclusively for his magazine  and 
having sounded his contributor  and found him 
only too willing  engaged him to assist in the 
editorial duties of the messenger at a salary of 
about one hundred guineas      dollars  per 
annum  in consequence of this appointment 
poe at once removed from baltimore to rich  
mond  virginia  where the magazine was pub  



   memoir  

lished  griswold  in order to suit dates to one 
of his allegations against poe  states that he 
was appointed editor of the messenger in may  
whereas he only became assistant editor in 
september  and did not assume the full control 
of the publication until december        the 
unfavorable notice of mr  laughton osborne s 
 confessions of a poet   which appeared in 
the april number  and which griswold  in 
order to support his charge of inconsistency  
ascribed to poe  was obviously never written 
by the poet at all  its style is a sufficient dis  
proof of the allegation  the following letter  
which poe wrote to his friend kennedy to tell 
him of his appointment on the messenger  
affords a sad picture of the terrible melancholia 
under which the poet so frequently suffered 
an affliction not merely the result of privations 
and grief  but undoubtedly  to some extent  
inherited   

 richmond  september n        
 dear sir i received a letter from dr  miller  in 
which he tells me you are in town  i hasten  therefore  
to write you  and express by letter what i have always 
found it impossible to express orally my deep sense of 
gratitude for your frequent and ineffectual assistance 
and kindness  through your influence mr  white has 
been induced to employ me in assisting him with the 
editorial duties of his magazine  at a salary of five hun  
dred and twenty dollars per annum  the situation is 
agreeable to me for many reasons  but  alas   it appears 
to me that nothing can give me pleasure or the slightest 
gratification  excuse me  my dear sir  if in this letter 
you find much incoherency  my feelings at this moment 
are pitiable indeed  i am suffering under a depression 
of spirits such as i have never felt before  i have 
struggled in vain against the influence of this melan  



memoik       

choly  you will believe me when i say that i am still 
miserable in spite of the great improvement in my cir  
cumstances  i say you will believe me  and for this 
simple reason  that a man who is writing for effect does 
not write thus  my heart is open before you  if it be 
worth reading  read it  i am wretched and know not 
why  console me for you can  but let it be quickly  
or it will be too late  write me immediately  convince 
me that it is worth one s while that it is at all necessary 
to live  and you will prove yourself indeed my friend  
persuade me to do what is right  i do mean this  i 
do not mean that you should consider what i now write 
you a jest  oh  pity me   for i feel that my words are 
incoherent  but i will recover myself  you will not fail 
to see that i am suffering under a depression of spirits 
which will ruin me should it be long continued  write 
me then and quickly  urge me to do what is right  
your words will have more weight with me than the 
words of others  for you were my friend when no one 
else was  fail not  as you value your peace of mind 
hereafter  e  a  poe   

to this wail of despair mr  kennedy sent the 
following kindly if commonplace reply  

 i am sorry to see you in such a plight as your 
letter shows you in  it is strange that just at this time  
when everybody is praising you  and when fortune is 
beginning to smile upon your hitherto wretched circum  
stances  you should be invaded by these blue devils  it 
belongs  however  to your age and temper to be thus 
buffeted but be assured  it only wants a little resolu  
tion to master the adversary forever  you will doubt  
less do well henceforth in literature  and add to your 
comforts  as well as to your reputation  which it gives 
me pleasure to assure you is everywhere rising in pop  
ular esteem   

notwithstanding his  blue devils   as mr  
kennedy styled it  the new editor worked won  
ders with the messenger   his talents made 
that periodical quite brilliant while he was 



   memoir  

connected with it   records this friend  and 
indeed in little more than a twelvemonth poe 
raised its circulation from seven hundred to 
nearly five thousand  this success was par  
tially due to the originality and fascination of 
poe s stories  and partially owing to the fear  
lessness of his trenchant critiques  he could 
not be made  either by flattery or abuse  a re  
specter of persons  in the december number of 
the messenger he began that system of literary 
scarification that crucial dissection of book  
making mediocrities  which  whilst it created 
throughout the length and breadth of the 
states a terror of his powerful pen  at the same 
time raised up against him a host of implaca  
ble  though unknown  enemies  who were only 
too glad  from that time  to seize upon and 
repeat any story  however improbable  to his 
discredit  far better would it have been for 
his future welfare if  instead of affording con  
temporary nonentities a chance of literary im  
mortality by impaling them upon his pen s 
sharp point  he had devoted his whole time to 
the production of his wonderful stories  or still 
more wonderful poems  why could he not 
have left the task of crushing or puffing the 
works of his liliputian contemporaries to the 
ordinary  disappointed authors   

during the whole of      poe devoted his 
entire attention to the messenger  producing 
tales  poems  essays  and reviews in profusion  
indeed  apparently at mr  white s suggestion  
frittering away his genius over these last  
early in the year a gleam of hope seemed to 



memoir     

break in upon his checkered career  in rich  
mond  once more among his kindred  he met 
and married his cousin  virginia  the daughter 
of his father s sister  maria  miss clemm was 
but a girl in years  and already manifested 
symptoms of the family complaint  consump  
tion  but  undeterred by this or by his slender 
income  the poor poet was married to his kins  
woman  and  it must be confessed  in happier 
circumstances  a better helpmate could scarcely 
have been found for him  while the marriage 
had the further advantage of bringing him 
under the motherly care of his aunt  mrs  
clemm  until january        poe continued 
the direction of the messenger  when he left it 
for the more lucrative employment of assisting 
professors anthon  hawks and henry in the 
management of the new york quarterly re  
view  and  probably  to aid the first in his clas  
sical labors a work for which his scholarly 
attainment rendered him invaluable  mr  
white parted with poe very reluctantly  and 
in the number of the messenger which con  
tained the announcement of poe s resignation  
issued a note to the subscribers  wherein  after 
alluding to the abjlity with which the retiring 
editor had conducted the magazine  he re  
marked   mr  poe  however  will continue to 
furnish its columns from time to time with the 
effusions of his vigorous and popular pen   
we dwell upon this incident  and upon the 
fact  more than once acknowledged by mr  
white  that poe resigned for other employ  



   memoir  

ment  because griswold expressly declares 
that he was dismissed for drunkenness  

from richmod  poe removed to new york  
where he and his household resided in carmine 
street  in his writing for the new york 
quarterly review  says mr  powell      he came 
down pretty freely with his critical ax  and 
made many enemies   these reviews display 
his immense learning  and the extraordinary 
range of subjects with which he was convers  
ant  but it is impossible to peruse them with  
out grieving at the loss literature sustained by 
his dissipating his powers over such ephemera  
the late mr  william gowans  the wealthy 
and respected  but eccentric bibliopolist  of 
new york  has left us a most interesting pict  
ure of the poet s menage at this period of his 
story  alluding to the untruthfulness of the 
prevalent idea of poe s character  the shrewd 
old man remarks   i  therefore  will also show 
you my opinion of this gifted but unfortunate 
genius  it may be estimated as worth little  
but it has this merit it comes from an eye 
and ear witness  and this  it must be remem  
bered  is the very highest of legal evidence  
for eight months or more one house contained 
us  one table fed  during that time i saw 
much of him  and had an opportunity of con  
versing with him often  and i must say that i 
never saw him the least affected with liquor  
nor even descend to any known vice  while he 
was one of the most courteous gentlemanly  
and intelligent companions i have met with 
during my journeyings and haltings through 



memoir     

divers divisions of the globe   besides  he had 
an extra inducement to be a good man as well 
as a good husband  for he had a wife of match  
less beauty and loveliness  her eyes could 
match that of any houri  and her face defy the 
genius of a canova to imitate   a temper and 
disposition of surpassing sweetness  besides  
she seemed as much devoted to him and his 
every interest as a young mother is to her 
first born        poe had a remarkably pleas  
ing and prepossessing countenance  what the 
ladies would call decidedly handsome   

through the courtesy of a correspondent we 
are permitted to extract the following addi  
tional testimony from a private letter written 
by mr  thomas c  latto  a friend of mr  
gowans  on the  th july         in con  
versation with william gowans   says mr  
latto   he told me that he was a boarder in 
the house of mrs  clemm        mr  poe and 
his young wife  whom mr  g  describes as 
fragile in constitution but of remarkable 
beauty  boarded at that time with mrs  clemm  
they were in poor circumstances  mr  
gowans lived with them several months  and 
he was often consulted by mrs  clemm as to 
the ways and means  as the boarding house 
business did not pay  he only left when the 
household was broken up  of course  mr  
gowans had the best opportunity of seeing 
what kind of life the poet led  his testimony 
is  that he  poe  was uniformly quiet  reticent  
gentlemanly in demeanor  and during the 
whole period he lived there  not the slightest 

  foe s poems 



   memoir  

trace of intoxication or dissipation was dis  
cernible in the illustrious inmate  who was at 
that time engaged in the composition of 
arthur gordon pym  poe kept good hours  
and all his little wants were seen to both by 
mrs  clemm and her daughter  who watched 
him as sedulously as if he had been a child  
mr  gowans is himself a man of intelligence  
and being a scotchman  is by no means averse 
to   a twa handed crack    but he felt himself 
kept at a distance somewhat by poe s aristo  
cratic reserve   

   mr  gowans   remarks mr  latto   t is 
known to be one of the most truthful and un  
compromising of men   

during january and february of this year 
       poe contributed the first portions of 
 the narrative of arthur gordon pym  to 
the messenger  and encouraged by the interest 
it excited  he determined to complete it  it 
 vas not published in book form  however  until 
july of the following year  and although it did 
not excite much attention in america  it was 
very successful in england  griswold  dis  
playing his usual animus  remarks  that copies 
being sent to england  and it    being mistaken 
at first for a narrative of real experiences  it 
was advertised to be reprinted  but a discovery 
of its character  i believe  prevented such a 
result  an attempt is made in it   he contin  
ues     by simplicity of style  minuteness of 
nautical descriptions  and circumstantiality of 
narration  to give it that air of truth which 
constitutes the principal attraction of sir 



memoir     

edward seaward s narrative  and  robinson 
crusoe    but it has none of the pleasing inter  
est of these tales   it is as full of wonders as 
 munchausen   has as many atrocities as the 
 book of pirates   and as liberal array of pain  
ing and revolting horrors as ever was invented 
by anne radcliffe or george walker   his 
further deprecatory remarks are not worth 
reproducing  the fact is that in a short in  
terval the story was several times reprinted in 
england  and it did excite considerable notice  
the  air of truth   which  it is suggested  
was only in the attempt  having attracted 
much interest  

the independence which poe had hoped to 
earn by his pen was not obtainable in those 
days at new york  and having prospect of 
constant employment in philadelphia  he re  
moved to that city late in       and entered 
into an arrangement to write for the gentle  
man s magazine  a publication of some years  
standing  his talents soon produced the usual 
brilliant effects upon this publication  and in 
may        he was appointed to the editorial 
management   devoting to it   says griswold  
 for ten dollars a week  two hours every day  
which left him abundant time for more im  
portant labors   what leisure his editorial 
duties may have left was devoted to writing 
for other publications  and as several of his 
tales and other compositions first made their 
appearance at this time  it is to be presumed 
that he managed to obtain a fair livelihood  
still he was not only compelled to labor con  



   memoir  

tinuously and severely  but was frequently 
forced by the res angusta domi to forsake his 
legitimate province in literature  and turn his 
pen to any project that offered a certain remu  
neration  there is a scandalous story told of 
him by griswold in support of his wholesale 
denunciation of poe as a plagiarist  and which  
although the accuser does not state to what 
period of the poet s life it refers  really relates 
to this epoch  griswold  on the authority  he 
asserts  of a philadelphian newspaper  declares 
that poe reprinted a popular work on conchol  
ogy  written by the well known naturalist  
captain thomas brown  as by himself   and 
actually took out a copyright for the american 
edition of captain brown s work  and omitting 
all mention of the english original  pretended 
in the preface to have been under great obli  
gations to several scientific gentlemen of this 
city   for ten years after poe s death this 
vile calumny circulated unanswered wherever 
the poet s biography was told  and although 
many of the american literati must have 
known the untruth of the story  no one vent  
ured to explain the facts until ultimately it 
came under the notice of the   person of all 
others best able to disprove it  which he did 
through the columns of the home journal  
professor wyatt  a scotchman of considerable 
erudition and scientific attainments  formed 
poe s acquaintance  and obtained his assistance 
in the compilation of several works on natural 
history  among others was a  manual of con  
chology   and to this  poe  whose scientific 



memoir     

knowledge was most comprenensive and 
exact  contributed so largely that the publish  
ers were fully justified in using his popular 
name on the title page  although he only 
received a share of the profits  captain 
brown s  text book of concholcgy    necessa  
rily bear s some resemblance to the combined 
work of poe and wyatt  from the simple fact 
that both treatises are founded by the system 
laid down by lamarck  but the absurd charge 
that one is therefore plagiarized from the other 
can only have arisen from gross ignorance or 
willful falsehood  about this time poe also 
published  as a sequence of such studies  a 
translation and di gest of lemonnier s  nat  
ural history   and other relative writings  

in the autumn of       poe made a collec  
tion of his best stories  and published them in 
two volumes as tales of the  arabesque and 
grotesque   this collection contained some 
of his most imaginative writing  and still fur  
ther increased its author s reputation  it in  
cluded the story of  the fall of the house of 
usher  a story which contains the charac  
teristic poem of  the haunted palace   
griswold avers that poe was indebted to long  
fellow s  beleaguered city  for his idea of 
this exquisite poem  but that poe asserted 
longfellow to have been indebted to him for 
the idea  we do not believe in plagiarisms  
as a rule  and whether the author of  the 
haunted palace  did  or did not  accuse his 
brother bard of robbery we know not  but 
must simply point out that poe  s poem had 



   memoir  

been published long prior to longfellow s  
and not  a few weeks   as griswold says  and 
in two different publications  the resem  
blance was probably purely accidental  but at 
all events  tennyson had worked out the same 
idea many years previous to either in  the 
deserted house   published in i  o  ligeia   
poe s favorite tale  also appeared in this col  
lection  on a copy of this weird story  in our 
possession  is an indorsement by the poet to 
the effect that  ligeia was also suggested by 
a dream   the  also  referring to a poem sent 
to mrs  whitman  and which  he remarks to 
her   contained all the events of a dream which 
occurred soon after i knew you      

towards the close of       mr  george r  
graham  owner of the casket  acquired pos  
session of the gentleman s magazine  and 
merging the two publications into one  began 
the new series as graham s magazine  a title 
which  it is believed  it still  retains  the new 
proprietor was only too willing to retain the 
services of the brilliant editor  and he found 
his reward in so doing edgar poe  assisted by 
mr  graham s liberality to his contributors  in 
little more than two years raising the number 
of subscribers to the magazine from five to 
fifty two thousand  his daring critiques  his 
analytic essays  and his weird stories  follow  
ing one another in rapid succession  startled 
the public into a knowledge of his power  he 
created new enemies  however  by the daunt  
less intrepidity with which he assailed the 
fragile reputations of the small book makers  



memoir     

especially by tthe publication of his papers on 
   autography   he also excited much crit  
icism in literary circles by the publication of 
his papers on  cryptology   in which he pro  
mulgated the theory that human ingenuity 
could not construct  any cryptograph which 
human ingenuity could not decipher  tested 
by several correspondents with difficult samples 
of their skill  the poet actually took the trouble 
to examine and solve them in triumphant 
proof of the truth of his theory  

in april        he published in graham s 
magazine  tale of  the murders in the rue 
morgue   the first of a series illustrating 
another analytic phase of his many sided mind  
this story was the first to introduce his name 
to the french public  being translated  and 
published as an original story by le commerce  
under the title of  l orang otang   shortly 
afterwards it was translated again  and 
appeared in the pages of la quotidienne  
whereupon a cry was raised  a lawsuit insti  
tuted  and ultimately the truth discovered  that 
edgar poe  an american  was the author  
madam mannier availed herself of the interest 
created by this inquiry to translate several of 
his stories for the french papers  whilst the 
revue des deux mondes  revue francaise and 
other leading publications spoke in highly flat  
tering terms of the young foreigner s produc  
tions  this gave an impetus to his reputation 
in france  which culminated in the faithfully 
vraisemblant translations of baudelaire  who  
indeed  spent many years of his life in an 



   memoir  

endeavor to thoroughly identify hi   mind  nth 
that of his idol edgar poe  and who has repro  
duced many of his stories with but little loss 
of vigor or originality  indeed  to the efforts 
and genius of baudelaire is chiefly due the fact 
that poe s tales have become standard classic 
works in france  edgar poe is veritably  it 
may be pointed out  the only american writer 
really well known and popular in france  in 
spain  too  poe s tales early acquired fame  and 
have now become thoroughly nationalized   
and with the exception of works on spanish 
subjects  such as those by washington irving  
prescott and motley  are the only american 
works known in that country  in germany  
the poems and tales have been frequently 
translated  but it is only quite recently that 
they attaimed any widely diffused celebrity 
amongst the germans  

in       appeared  the descent into the 
maelstrom   a tale that in many respects may 
be deemed one of his most marvelous and 
idiosyncratic  it is one of those tales which  
like  the gold  bug  and others  demonstrates 
the untenabili ty of the theory first promulgated 
by griswold  and since so frequently echoed 
by his copyists  that poe s ingenuity in unrid  
dling a mystery was only ingenious in appear  
ance  as he himself had woven the webs he so 
dexterously unweaves  the tales cited  how  
ever  prove the falseness of this portion of 
griswold s systematic depreciation of poe s 
genius  they are the secrets of nature which 
be unveils  and not the riddles of art  he did 



memoir     

not invent the natural truth that a cylindrical 
body  swimming in a vortex  offered more 
resistance to its suction  and was drawn in with 
greater difficulty than bodies of any other form 
of equal bulk  any more than he invented the 
mathematical ratio in which certain letters of 
the english alphabet recur in all documents of 
any length  he did not invent  the mystery 
of marie roget    but he tore away the mys  
teriousness and laid bare the truth of that 
strange story of real life  he did not invent  
but he was the first to describe  if not to dis  
cover  those peculiar idiosyncrasies of the 
human mind so wonderfully but so clearly 
displayed in  the murders in the rue 
morgue    the purloined letter    the 
imp of the perverse   and other remarkable 
proofs of his mastery over the mental strings 
and pulleys of our being  

it was during his brilliant editorship of gra  
ham s magazine that poe discovered and first 
introduced to the american public the genius 
of elizabeth barrett browning  and it was 
whilst he held sw y over it that she contributed 
to its  pages man  of her shorter poems  
indeed  it was greatly due to poe that her 
fame in america was coeval with if it did not 
somewhat precede that wo by her in her native 
land  in may        he contributed to the 
philadelphia saturday evening post a paper 
belonging to mr  graham  and for which poe 
wrote   that prospective notice of the newly  
commenced story of  barnaby rudge   which 
drew from dickens a letter of admiring 

  poe e poems 



   memoir  

acknowledgment  in this notice the poet with 
mathematical precision explained and foretold 
the exact plot of the as yet unwritten story  
professor wyatt  already alluded to in connec  
tion with the conchology story  was not only a 
contributor of articles on natural history to 
graham s  but at this time  and for several 
years  was intimately acquainted with poe  and 
we have his unimpeachable authority for the 
invariable honor and purity of the poet s life 
in november         the mystery of marie 
roget  appeared  and about the same time poe 
resigned his post of joint editor and reviewer 
of graham s magazine  why or wherefore was 
never stated  but that it was not through drunk  
enness  as alleged by griswold the successor 
to poe s editorial duties mr  graham s own 
famous letter of      conclusively proves  
poe s idea would appear to have been to start 
a magazine of his own  but his resignation may 
perhaps be justly ascribed to that constitutional 
restlessness which from time to time over  
powered him  and drove him from place to place 
in a vain search after the eldorado of his 
hopes  the truth as to his severance from 
graham s  like so many of the details that 
enshroud and confuse his life s story  was 
probably purposely mystified by poe  who had 
even a greater love than had byron of mysti  
fying the impertinent busy bodies who wearied 
him for biographical information  it was 
shortly previous to this epoch in his life that 
he had the misfortune to make the acquaint  
ance of rufus griswold  a man who  although 



memoir     

several years poe s junior in age  had  by many 
years   knocking about the world   gained an 
experience of its shifts and subterfuges and 
made him far more than a match for the 
unworldly nature of our poet  according to 
the author of the  memoir   his acquaintance 
with poe began in the spring of       by the 
poet calling at his hotel and leaving two letters 
of introduction   the next morning   he 
says   i visited him  and we had a long con  
versation about literature and literary men  
pertinent to the subject of a book   the poets 
and poetry of america   which i was then 
preparing for the press   and he follows up 
this introductory interview with the quotation 
of several letters purporting to have been 
written by poe  not one of which we shall refer 
to or make use of  as there is pretty positive 
proof that some  if not the whole of them  are 
fabrications  the enmity of griswold for 
poe  the long  intense  and implacable 
enmity   alluded to by john neal and mr  
graham is so palpable to readers of the 
 memoir   that it needed not the outside evi  
dence which has been so abundantly furnished 
us to prove it  and the wonder is  not so much 
that the biographer s audacious falsifications 
should have obtained credit abroad  as that no 
american should have produced as complete a 
refutation of them as could and should have 
been given years ago  apart from deadly 
enmity  aroused by a subject of a domestic 
nature  the compiler could not forgive poe for 
exposing his literary shortcomings  the only 



   memoir  

passage in which the soi disant biographer 
appears to relent towards the dead poet is that 
in which he alludes to his own visit to poe s 
residence in philadelphia    it was while he 
resided in philadelphia   griswold remarks  
 that i became acquainted with him  his 
manner was very quiet and gentlemanly  he 
was usually dressed with simplicity and ele  
gance  and when once he sent for me to visk 
him  during a period of illness caused by pro  
tracted and anxious watching at the side of his 
sick wife  i was impressed by the singular neat  
ness and the air of refinement in his home  
it was in a smr ll house in one of the pleasant 
and silent neighborhoods far from the town  
and  though slightly and cheaply furnished  
everything in it was so tastefully and fitly dis  
posed that it seemed altogether suitable for a 
man of genius    on seceding from graham s  
poe seems to have endeavored to start a mag  
azine of his own  to be entitled the stylus  and 
mr  thomas c  clark  of philadelphia  was to 
have been the publisher  the poet does not 
appear to have been enabled to obtain a suffi  
cient number of subscribers to start the pro  
jected publication on a sound basis  and there  
fore the scheme fell through  mr  clark  who 
is still residing in philadelphia  speaks in high 
terms of poe s probity and honor  as indeed 
does every one  save griswold  who had deal  
ings with him  it is much to be regretted 
that circumstances have prevented mr  clark 
giving to the world his reminiscences and col  
lected facts relating to edgar poe  



memoir     

in the spring of      the one hundred dollar 
prize  offered by the dollar magazine  was 
obtained by poe for his tale of  the gold  
bug   a tale illustrative of and originating 
with his theory of ciphers  as usual  gris  
wold  in mentioning it  cannot refrain from 
displaying the cloven hoof  and  knowing it to 
be the most popular of poe s stories in amer  
ica  refers to it  as one of the most remarkable 
illustrations of his ingenuity of construction and 
apparent subtlety of reasoning    during this 
year poe wrote for lowell s pioneer  and other 
publications  in      he removed to new york  
whither his daily increasing fame had already 
preceded him  and where he entered into a 
more congenial literary atmosphere than that 
in which he had recently resided  in the cities 
in which he had hitherto exercised his talents 
he was continually treading upon the mental 
corns of provincial cliques  but in new york  
as he now entered it  he found a neare 
approach to metropolitanism  and therefore a 
fairer field for the recognition of his powers  
 for the first time   remarks griswold  com  
pletely ignoring the talent of all other american 
cities   for the first time he was received into 
circles capable of both the appreciation and 
the production of literature      it has generally 
been assumed that the first publication he 
wrote for in new york was the daily mirror  
but the author of a sketch of willis and his 
contemporaries contributed to the northern 
monthly in       referring to poe as  one who 
has been more shamefully maligned and slan  



   memoir  

dered than any other writer that can be 
named   states   i say this from personal 
knowledge of mr  poe  who was associated with 
myself in the editorial conduct of my own 
paper before his introduction into the office of 
messrs  willis and morris   adding   for mr  
willis s manly vindication of poe from his 
biographer s degrading accusations   he says  
  mr  willis s testimony is freely confirmed by 
other publishers  on this subject i have some 
singular revelations which throw a strong light 
on the causes that darkened the life  and made 
most unhappy the death  of one of the most 
remarkable of all our literary men as an eng  
lish re viewer once said  the most brilliant gen  
ius of his country     

toward the autumn of the year poe sought 
and found employment as sub editor and 
critic on the mirror  a daily paper belonging 
to n  p  willis and general george morris  

in a letter written by willis from idlewild  
in october        to his brother poet and for  
mer copartner morris  he thus alludes to poe s 
engagement with him   poe came to us 
quite incidentally  neither of us having been 
personally acquainted with him till that time  
and his position towards us  and connection 
with us  of course unaffected by claims of pre  
vious friendship  were a fair average of his 
general intercourse and impressions  as he 
was a man who never smiled and never said a 
propitiatory or deprecating word  we were not 
likely to have been seized with any sudden 
dartialitv or wavward caprice in his favor        



memoir     

it was rather a step downward  after being the 
chief editor of several monthlies  as poe had 
been  to come into the office of a daily journal 
as a mechanical paragraphist  it was his bus  
iness to sit at a desk  in a corner of the edi  
torial room  ready to be called upon for any of 
the miscellaneous work of the day  yet you re  
member how absolutely and how good humored 
ly ready he was for any suggestion  how punctu  
ally and industriously reliable in the following 
out of the wish once expressed   how cheerful 
and present minded his work when he might 
excusably have been so listless and abstracted  
we loved the man for the entireness of the 
fidelity with which he served us  when he 
left us  we were very reluctant to part with 
him  but we could not object he was to take 
the lead in another periodical   

during the six months or so that poe was 
engaged on the mirror the whole of which 
time willis asserts    he was invariably punc  
tual and industrious   and was daily  at his 
desk in the office from nine in the morning till 
the evening paper went to press  during this 
time some of the most remarkable productions 
of his genius  including his poetic chef d oeuvre 
of  the raven   were given to the world  
this unique and most original of poems first 
appeared in col ton s american review for 
february        as by  quarles    it was at 
once reprinted in the evening mirror  and in 
a few weeks had spread over the whole of the 
united states  calling into existence parodies 
and imitations innumerable  mrs  whitman 



   memoir  

informs us that  when  the raven   appeared  
poe one evening electrified the gay company 
assembled at a weekly reunion of noted artists 
and men of letters  held at the residence of an 
accomplished poetess in waverley place  by the 
recitation  at the request of his hostess  of this 
wonderful poem  after this  it was of course 
impossible to keep the authorship secret  
willis reprinted the poem with the author s 
name attached  remarking that  in his opinion  
 it was the most effective single example of 
fugitive poetry ever published in this country  
and is unsurpassed in english poetry for subtle 
conception  masterly ingenuity of versifica  
tion  and consistent sustaining of imaginative 
lift   it carried its author s name and fame 
from shore to shore  drew admiring testimony 
from some of the first of english poets  and 
finally made him the lion of the season  and 
for this masterpiece of genius this poem 
which has probably done more for the renown 
of american letters than any other single work 
it is alleged that poe  then at the height of 
his renown  received the sum of ten dollars  
that is  about two pounds  

in the february number of graham s maga  
zine for this same year appeared a biographi  
cal and critical sketch of edgar poe by james 
russell lowell  in many respects we deem it 
the best critique on his genius that we have 
yet seen  and although the estimate formed of 
poe s poetic precocity may not be perfectly 
just  it is difficult to find fault with the admir  
able analyzation of his prose writings  it is 



memoir    

somewhat singular  however  that in the col  
lection of poe s works edited by griswold  mr  
lowell should permit the continual reprinting 
of this critique  with a few alterations and 
omissions   when those very omissions 
serve to give color to one of griswold s vilest 
charges  that of the alleged theft of captain 
brown s conchology book  in the beginning 
of this year the broadway journal was started  
and in march poe was associated with two 
journalists in its management  he had writ  
ten for it from the first  but had nothing to do 
with the editorial arrangement until the tenth 
number  one of the most noticeable of his 
contributions was a critique on the poems of 
elizabeth barrett browning  to whom he 
shortly afterwards dedicated  in most admiring   
terms  a selection of his poems  published by 
messrs  wiley & putman  under the title  the 
raven and other poems   about the same 
time the same firm published a selection from 
his prose compositions as  tales   and another 
firm reprinted his  tales of the grotesque and 
picturesque   so that his name was kept well 
before the public  

several of the stories were nov  published in 
an english collection  as was also  the 
raven   mrs  browning  in a private letter 
written a few weeks after the publication of 
the poem  says   this vivid writing this 
power which is felt has produced a sensation 
here in england  some of my friends are 
taken by the fear of it  and some by the music  
i hear of persons who are haunted by the 



   memoir  

 never more   and an acquaintance of mine 
who has the misfortune of possessing a bust of 
pallas cannot bear to look at it in the twilight    
and then alluding to poe s story of  mesmeric 
revelations   which some english journals 
accepted as a faithful record of facts  the 
poetess resumes    then there is a tale going 
the rounds of the newspapers about mesmer  
ism  which is throwing us all into  most 
admired disorder  dreadful doubts as to 
whether it can be true  as the children say of 
ghost stories  the certain thing about it is 
the power of the writer    

by this time edgar poe had become person  
ally known to and admired by a large number 
of the literati of new york   whose interest 
in his writings   remarks mrs  whitman  
 was manifestly enhanced by the perplexing 
anomalies of his character  and by the singular 
magnetism of his presence   one who knew 
him at this period of his life  says   every  
thing about him distinguished him as a man of 
mark  his countenance  person  and gait  
were alike characteristic  his features were 
regular  and decidedly handsome  his com  
plexion was clear and dark   the color of his 
fine eyes seemingly a dark gray  but on closer 
inspection they were seen to be of that neutral 
violet tint which is so difficult to define  his 
forehead was  without exception  the finest in 
proportion and expression that we have ever 
seen   

edgar poe left the mirror to take charge of 
the broadway journal  the sole management 



memoir     

of which  however  did not devolve upon him 
until july  whilst it was not till the following 
october that he became proprietor as well as 
editor of this publication  his confederates 
do not appear to have invested much money 
or talent in the undertaking  and when they 
retired and left the poet in entire possession of 
the publication  he would not seem to have 
added much to his worldly goods by the acqui  
sition  

in march he gave a lecture on the american 
poets in the library of the new york historical 
society  and it attracted much attention  not 
only by the originality and courage of his re  
marks  but by the fascination of his presence  
by his eloquence  and personal beauty  the 
furore which his lecture created caused him to 
be asked to boston  and in the autumn he 
accepted an invitation to recite a poem in the 
lyceum of that city   when he accepted the 
invitation   avers griswold   he intended to 
write an original poem  upon a subject which 
he said had haunted his imagination for years  
but cares  anxieties  and feebleness of will 
prevented  and a week before the appointed 
night he wrote a friend imploring assistance  
 you compose with such astonishing facility   
he urged in his letter   that you can easily fur  
nish one quite soon enough  a poem that shall 
be equal to my reputation  for the love of 
god i beseech you to help me in this extrem  
ity    the lady wrote him kindly  advising 
him judiciously  but promising to attempt the 
fulfillment of his wishes  she was  however  



   memoir  

an invalid  and so failed  at last  instead of 
pleading illness  as he had previously done on 
a similar occasion  he determined to read his 
poem  of  al aaraaf     it is impossible to 
say how much  if any  of his story is true  
that a poem equal to his reputation could have 
been composed in a week  or in any length of 
time  by mrs  osgood  the friend alluded to  
none knew better to be impossible than poe  
the lady  however  died before the publica  
tion of the  memoirs   therefore griswold  
who was her confidant  was pretty safe in tell  
ing the tale  one who was present on the 
occasion of the recitation informs us that the 
lecture course of the boston lyceum was wan  
ing in popularity  and that poe s fame being at 
its zenith  he was invited to deliver a poem at 
the opening of the winter session      i remem  
ber him well   he remarks   as he came on 
the platform  he was the best realization of 
a poet in feature  air  and manner  that i had 
ever seen  and the unusual paleness of his face 
added to its aspect of melancholy interest  he 
delivered a poem that no one understood  but 
at its conclusion gave the audience a treat 
which almost redeemed their disappointment  
this was the recitation of his own  raven   
which he repeated with thrilling effect  it 
was something well worth treasuring in mem  
ory     poe   he adds   after he returned to 
mew york  was much incensed at boston criti  
cism on his poem   

the poet was not probably incensed to any 
very great extent   but doubtless found it a 



memoir     

profitable hit for his journal to make what he 
termed a  bobbery    a week after the lec  
ture  therefore  he began to comment  in a 
tone of playful badinage  upon the remarks 
made by some bostonian papers with respect 
to it  in the broadway journal for november 
ist  poe  after quoting a paragraph from a 
paper defending him from the abuse of the 
boston journals  says   our excellent friend 
major noah has suffered himself to be cajoled 
by that most beguiling of all little divinities  
miss walters of the transcript  we have 
been looking all over her article  with the aid 
of a taper  to see if we could discover a single 
syllable of truth in it  and really blush to ac  
knowledge that we cannot  the adorable 
creature has been telling a parcel of fibs about 
us  by way of revenge for something that we 
did to mr  longfellow  who admires her very 
much   and for calling her  a pretty little 
witch  into the bargain  

 the facts of the case seem to be these  
we were invited to  deliver   stand and deliver  
a poem before the boston lyceum  as a mat  
ter of course  we accepted the invitation  the 
audience was  large and distinguished   mr  
gushing preceded us with a very capital dis  
course  he was much applauded  on arising 
we were most cordially received  we occu  
pied some fifteen minutes with an apology for 
not  delivering   as is usual in such cases  a di  
dactic poem a didactic poem  in our opinion  
being precisely no poem at all  after some 
further words still of apology for the  in  



   memoir  

definiti veness    and  general imbecility  of 
what we had to offer all so unworthy of a 
bostonian audience we commenced  and  
with many interruptions of applause  con  
cluded  upon the whole  the approbation was 
considerably more  the more the pity  too  than 
that bestowed upon mr  gushing     

 when we had made an end  the audience 
of course arose to depart  and about one tenth 
of them probably had really departed when 
mr  coffin  one of the managing committee  
arrested those who remained by the announce  
ment that we had been requested to deliver 
the raven   we delivered  the raven  
forthwith  without taking a receipt   were very 
cordially applauded again  and this was the end 
of it  with the exception of the sad tale in  
vented  to suit her own purposes  by that ami  
able little enemy of ours  miss walters  we 
shall never call a  woman  a pretty little witch  
again as long as we live   

there is a great deal more to the same effect  
the whole of which griswold reprinted in his 
 memoir   but we have been unable to per  
ceive in its good natured bantering anything 
objectionable  although poe s biographer ap  
pears to have discovered something terrible 
hidden in the jokes about the bostonians and 
their  frog pond   and deems  it is scarcely 
necessary to suggest that this must have been 
written before he had quite recovered from the 
long intoxication which maddened him at the 
time to which it refers   as  the time to 
which it refers  was evidently that of the lee  



memoir     

ture  and as it was written upwards of a week 
after that event  and as poe renewed the dis  
cussion in the same tone three weeks later  
 the long intoxication  must indeed have been 
an unusually lengthy one  one paragraph 
from poe s second notice of the affair will 
doubtless suffice   we know very well that  
among a certain clique of the frogpondians  
there existed a predetermination to abuse us 
under aay circumstances  we knew that write 
what we would they would swear it to be 
worthless  we knew that were we to compose 
for them a  paradise lost  they would pro  
nounce it an indifferent poem  it would have 
been very weak in us  then  to put ourselves 
to the trouble of attempting to please 
these people  we preferred pleasing our  
selves  we read before them a  juvenile   a 
very  juvenile   poem  and thus the frogpon  
dians were had  were delivered up to the 
enemy bound hand and foot  never were a 
set of people more completely demolished  
they have blustered and flustered  but what 
have they done or said that has not made them 
more thoroughly ridiculous  what in the name 
of thomas  is it possible for them to do or to 
say  we  delivered  them the  juvenile 
poem   and they received it with applause  
this is accounted for by the fact that the 
clique  contemptible in numbers as in every  
thing else  were overruled by the rest of the 
assembly  these malignants did not dare to 
interrupt by their preconcerted hisses the re  
spectful and profound attention of the major  



   memoir  

ity        the poem being thus well received in 
spite of this ridiculous little cable  the next 
thing to be done was to abuse it in the papers  
here they imagined they were sure of their 
game  but what have they accomplished  
the poem  they say  is bad  we admit it  
we insisted upon this fact in our prefatory re  
marks  and we insist upon it now  over and 
over again         

and these hurried newspaper jottings  which 
griswold himself admits were written when 
poe was suffering from  cares  anxieties  and 
feebleness of will   and when  as he elsewhere 
shows  the poor persecuted poet was in pecuni  
ary difficulties  and when  not able to pay for 
assistance  he was obliged somehow to write 
nearly all the journal himself  and yet  under 
all these conflicting ills  these few jocular  
although overstrained  jottings are unearthed 
and adduced as evidence of poe s irretrievably 
bad nature  it is a more pleasant task than 
having to refer to such distorted views of envy  
hatred  and malice  to turn to the picture which 
mrs  osgood gives of poe at this point in his 
life   my first meeting with the poet   she 
remarks   was at the astor house  a few 
days previous mr  willis had handed me at the 
table d hote that strange and thrilling poem 
entitled  the raven   saying that the author 
wanted my opinion of it  its effect upon me 
was so singular  so like that of  weird  un  
earthly music   that it was with a feeling 
almost of dread i heard he desired an intro  
duction  yet i could not refuse without seem  



memoir     

ing ungrateful  because i had just heard of his 
enthusiastic and partial eulogy of my writings 
in his lecture on american literature  i shall 
never forget the morning when i was sum  
moned to the drawing room by mr  willis to 
receive him  with his proud and beautiful 
head erect  his dark eyes flashing with the 
electric light of feeling and of thought  a pecu  
liar  an inimitable blending of sweetness and 
of hauteur in his expression and manner  he 
greeted me calmly  gravely  almost coldly  yet 
with so marked an earnestness that   could not 
help being deeply impressed by it  from that 
moment until his death we were friends   
again she writes of poe  i have never seen 
him otherwise than gentle  generous  well  
bred  and fastidiously refined  to a sensitive 
and delicately nurtured woman there was a 
peculiar and irresistible charm in the chivalric  
graceful  and almost tender reverence with 
which he invariably approached all women who 
won his respect   

another and still more devoted friend of the 
fascinating poet  mrs  whitman  quotes the 
opinions of  a woman of fine genius   who at 
this time made poe s acquaintance   t lt was 
in the brilliant circles   she says   that assem  
bled in the winter of         at the houses of 
mr  dewy  miss anna lynch  mr  lawson  
and others  that we first met edgar poe  his 
manners were at these reunions refined and 
pleasing  and his style and scope of conversa  
tion that of a gentleman and a scholar  what  
ever may have been his previous career  there 



   memoir  

was nothing in his appearance or manner to 
indicate his excesses  he delighted in the so  
ciety of superior women  and had an exquisite 
perception of all graces of manner and shades 
of  expression  we all recollect the interest 
felt at the time in everything emanating from 
his pen the relief it was from the dullness of 
ordinary writers the certainty of something 
fresh and suggestive  his critiques were read 
with avidity  not that he convinced the judg  
 ment  but that people felt their ability and 
their courage  right or wrong  he was ter  
ribly in earnest    and    as mrs  whitman 
adds   like de quincey  he never supposed any  
thing  he always knew   

this last lady  in her thoughtful work on 
 edgar poe and his critics  recounts an inci  
dent of the poet which occurred at one of the 
soirees he was accustomed to attend   a 
lady  noted for her great lingual attainments  
wishing to apply a wholesome check to the 
vanity of a young author  proposed inviting 
him to translate for the company a difficult 
passage in greek  of which language she knew 
him to be profoundly ignorant  although given 
to a rather pretentious display of greek quo  
tations in his published writings  poe s earn  
est and persistent remonstrance against this 
piece of mechancete alone averted the embar  
rassing test  trifling as this anecdote may 
appear  it is a good proof of that generous and 
charitable disposition which those who knew 
him only through griswold s  memoir   have 
so unwarrantably denied him the possession 



memoir     

of  reverting to mrs  whitman s book  we 
learn that  sometimes his fair young wife was 
seen with him at these weekly assemblages in 
waverley place  she seldom took part in the 
conversation  but the memory of her sweet 
and girlish face  always animated and viva  
cious  repels the assertion  afterwards so cruelly 
and recklessly made  that she died a victim 
to the neglect and unkindness of her 
husband  who  as it has been said   deliber  
ately sought her death that he might embalm 
her memory in immortal dirges     gilfillan 
tells us that poe caused the death of his wife 
that he might have a fitting theme for  the 
raven   but unfortunately for the truth of 
that reverend gentleman s theory  the poem 
was published two years previous to the event 
which he so ingeniously assumed it to com  
memorate  friend and foe alike  who knew 
anything of poe  bear testimony to the unvary  
ing kindness and affection of the poet for his 
youthful wife   it is well known to those ac  
quainted with the parties   says mrs  whit  
man   that the young wife of edgar poe died 
of lingering consumption  which manifested it  
self early in her girlhood  all who have had 
opportunities for observation in the matter 
have noticed her husband s tender devotion to 
her during her prolonged illness      it is 
true that  notwithstanding her vivacity and 
cheerfulness at the time we have alluded to  
her health was even then rapidly sinking  and 
it was for her dear sake  and for the recovery 
of that peace which had been so fatally imper  



   memoir  

iled amid the irritations and anxieties of his 
new york life  that poe left the city and re  
moved to the little dutch cottage in fordham  
where he passed the three remaining years of 
his life   

the labors of edgar poe during his posses  
sion of the broadway journal must have been 
enormous  week after week he wrote a large 
portion of its folio pages himself  in addition 
to performing the thousand duties of an edi  
torial proprietor the  much friendly assist  
ance   which griswold  who said also that he 
was friendless  asserts he received in his man  
agement of the journal  being chiefly confined 
to the contribution of a few verses  he was 
only able to comply with this great strain 
upon his mental and physical strength by re  
printing many of his published tales and poems 
in the columns of his paper  and even this sys  
tem could not have afforded very material re  
lief  as every article was submitted to the 
most scrutinizing supervision  and an infinity 
of corrections and alterations made  a jour  
nal of his own  in which he coald give vent to 
his untrammeled opinions  unchecked by the 
mercantile  and  undoubtedly  more prudential 
views of publishers  had long been one of poe  s 
most earnest desires  and he attained his wish 
in the possession of the broadway journal  
but poverty  ill health  want of worldly knowl  
edge  and a sick a dying wife  all combined 
to overpower his efforts  what could the un  
fortunate poet do  during the few months 
that he had complete control of the moribund 



memoir     

journal he made it  considering all things  as 
good a cheap literary paper as was ever pub  
lished  all his efforts  however  were insuffi  
cient to keep it alive  so  on the  d of janu  
ary        the poor poet was obliged to resign 
his favorite hobby of a paper of his own  it 
may be pointed out that whilst in possession 
of his journal he availed himself of the oppor  
tunity of displaying his almost quixotic feel  
ings of gratitude tho e feelings denied him 
by the ruthless griswold towards all who had 
befriended him  and n  t only to the living 
whose aid might continue  but towards those 
who had already entered into the  hollow 
vale   his generous tributes to departed 
worth are proofs of his nobility of heart  of 
greater weight than any disproof the malign  
ity of griswold would invent  

besides the work on his own paper  poe had 
somehow contrived to contribute a few tales 
and sketches to some of the magazines  and  
among others  to mr  godey s lady s book  
in the may number of this publication he com  
menced a series of critiques  entitled the  lit  
erati of new york    in which he professed   
remarks griswold  with his wonted sneer   to 
give some honest opinions at random respect  
ing their authorial merits   these essays 
were immensely successful  but the caustic 
style of some of them produced terrible com  
motion in the ranks of mediocrity  as may be 
seen from mr  godey s notes to the readers 
respecting the anonymous and other letters he 
receives concerning them   we are not to 



   memoir  

be intimidated    he remarks   by a threat of 
the loss of friends  or turned from our pur  
pose by honeyed words        many attempts 
have been made and are being made by vari  
ous persons to forestall public opinion  we 
have the name of one person  others are 
busy with reports of mr  poe s illness  mr  
poe has been ill  but we have letters from 
him of very recent dates  also a new batch of 
the literati  which shows anything but feeble  
ness either of body or mind  almost every 
paper that we exchange with has praised our 
new enterprise  and spoken in high terms of 
mr  poe s opinion   dissatisfied with the 
manner in which his literary weakness had 
been reviewed by poe  a dunn english or 
dunn brown  for he is duplicately named  
instead of waiting  as griswold did  for the 
poet s death  when every ass could have its 
kick at the lion s carcase   retaliated in a 
personal newspaper article   remarks duy  
ckinck in his invaluable encyclopedia  and  the 
communication was reprinted in the evening 
mirror in new york  whereupon poe instituted 
a libel suit against that journal  and recovered 
several hundred dollars for defamation of 
character      

if there be any one entertaining the 
slightest belief in griswold s veracity  let 
him now refer to his unfaithful account of this 
affair in the soi disant  memoir   and compare 
it with the facts of the case  he states that 
dunn english  chose to evince his resentment 
of the critic s unfairness by the publication of 



memoir     

a card  in which he painted strongly the in  
firmities of poe s life and character     poe s 
article   he continues   was entirely false in 
what purported to be the facts  the state  
ment of dr  english appeared in the new york 
mirror of the   d june  and on the   th mr  
poe sent to mr  godey  for publication in the 
lady s book  his rejoinder  which mr  godey 
very properly declined to print   this led  
asserts griswold   to a disgraceful quarrel   
and to the   premature conclusion  of the 
literati  and that poe  ceased to write for the 
lady s book in consequence of mr  godey s 
justifiable refusal to print in that miscellany 
his  reply to dr  english     poe s review 
of  english  appeared in the second or june 
number of the literati  and from our knowl  
edge of griswold  s habitual inaccuracy  we 
were not surprised to find  upon reference to 
the magazine  that the sketches ran their 
stipulated course until october  and after that 
date poe still continuing a contributor to the 
lady s book  nor were we surprised to find 
mr  godey writing to the knickerbocker 
magazine in defense and praise of poe s  hon  
orable and blameless conduct   but what cer  
tainly did startle us was to discover that the 
whole of the personalities of the supposed 
critique  included in the collection of poe s 
works edited by griswold  were absent from 
the real critique published in the lady s 
book  

recoiling from such unsavory subjects  it is 
a pleasant change to look upon the charming 



   memoir  

picture of the cruelly belibeled poet  and his 
diminutive menage  as portrayed by mrs  
osgood   it was in his own simple yet poeti  
cal home   she remarks   that to me the char  
acter of edgar poe appeared in its most beau  
tiful light  playful  affectionate  witty  
alternately docile and wayward as a petted 
child for his young  gentle  and idolized wife  
and for all who came  he had  even in the 
midst of his most harassing literary duties  a 
kind word  a pleasant smile  a graceful and 
courteous attention  at his desk  beneath 
the romantic picture of his loved and lost 
lenore  he would sit hour after hour  patient  
assiduous  and uncomplaining  tracing in an 
exquisitely clear chirography  and with almost 
superhuman swiftness  the lightning thoughts  
the  rare and radiant  fancies as they flashed 
through his wonderful and ever wakened 
brain  i recollect one morning toward the 
close of his residence in this city  when he 
seemed unusually gay and light hearted  vir  
ginia  his sweet wife  had written me a press  
ing invitation to come to them   and i  who 
could never resist her affectionate summons  
and who enjoyed his society far more in his 
own home than elsewhere  hastened to amity 
street  i found him just completing his series 
of papers entitled  the literati ot new york    
 see   said he  displaying in laughing triumph 
several little rolls of narrow paper  he always 
wrote thus for the press    i am going to show 
you  by the difference of length in these  the 
different degrees of estimation in which i hold 



memoir     

all you literary people  in each of these  one 
of you is rolled up and fully discussed  come  
virginia  help me   and one by one they 
unfolded them  at last they came to one 
which seemed interminable  virginia laugh  
ingly ran to one corner of the room with one 
end  and her husband to the opposite with the 
other    and whose lengthened sweetness long 
drawn out is that   said i   hear her   he 
cried   just as if her little vain heart didn t 
tell her it s herself     

it was in the summer of      that the poet 
removed his dying wife to the quietude and 
repose of the cottage at fordham  westchester 
county  near new york   here   exclaims 
mrs  whitman  in her exalted essay on  edgar 
poe and his critics  the noblest memorial 
yet raised to the poet s memory  here he 
watched her failing breath in loneliness and 
privation through many solitary moons  until  
on a desolate  dreary day of the ensuing win  
ter  he saw her remains borne from beneath 
its lowly roof    the fullest and most interest  
ing account of poe s life at fordham is to be 
found in the  reminiscences  of a brother 
author  of his first visit to fordham to see 
poe he says 

 we found him and his wife and his wife s 
mother  who was his aunt  living in a little 
cottage at the top of a hill  there was an acre 
or two of greensward  fenced in about the 
house  as smooth as velvet  and as clean as 
the best kept carpet  there was some grand 

  foe s poems  



   memoir  

old cherry trees in the yard that threw a mas  
sive shade around them  

 poe had somehow caught a full grown bob  
olink  he had put him in a cage  which he 
had hung on a nail driven into the trunk of a 
cherry tree  the poor bird was as unfit to 
live in his cage as his captor was to live in the 
world  he was as restless as his jailer  and 
sprang continually in a fierce  frightened way 
from one side of the cage to the other  i 
pitied him  but poe was bent on training him  
there he stood with his arms crossed before 
the tormented bird  his sublime trust in attain  
ing the impossible apparent in his whole self  
so handsome  so impassive in his wonderful  
intellectual beauty  so proud and reserved  
and yet so confidentially communicative  so 
entirely a gentleman upon all occasions that i 
ever saw him   so tasteful  so good a talker was 
poe that he impressed himself and his wishes  
even without words  upon those with whom 
he spoke      poe s voice was melody itself  
he always spoke low  even in a violent discus  
sion  compelling his hearers to listen if they 
would know his opinion  his facts  fancies  
philosophy  or his weird imaginings  these 
last usually flowed from his pen  seldom from 
his tongue  

  on this occasion i was introduced to the 
young wife of the poet  and to the mother  
then more than sixty years of age  she was a 
tall  dignified old lady  with a most lady like 
manner  and her black dress  though old and 
much worn  looked really elegant on her        



memoir     

mrs  poe looked very young  she had large 
black eyes  and a pearly whiteness of com  
plexion  which was a perfect pallor  her pale 
face  her brilliant eyes  and her raven hair 
gave her an unearthly look  one felt that she 
was almost a disrobed spirit  and when she 
coughed it was made certain that she was 
rapidly passing away  the mother seemed 
hale and strong  and appeared to be a sort of 
universal providence for her strange children  
 the cottage had an air of taste and gentility 
that must have been lent to it by the presence 
of its inmates  so neat  so poor  so unfur  
nished  and yet so charming a dwelling i never 
saw      the sitting room was laid with check 
matting  four chairs  a light stand  and a 
hanging book shelf completed its furniture  
there were pretty presentation copies of books 
on the little shelves  and the brownings had 
posts of honor on the stand  with quiet ex  
ultation poe drew from his side pocket a letter 
that he had recently received from elizabeth 
barrett browning  he read it to us  it was 
very flattering  she told poe that his poem 
of  the raven  had awakened a fit of horror 
in england      he was at this time greatly 
depressed  their extreme poverty  the sick  
ness of his wife  and his own inability to write 
sufficiently accounted for this      we strolled 
away into the woods  and had a very cheerful 
time till some one proposed a game of leaping  
i think it must have been poe  as he   was 
expert in the exercise  two or three gentle  
men agreed to leap with him  and though one 



   memoir  

of them was tall  and had been a hunter in 
times past  poe still distanced them all  but  
alas  his gaiters  long worn and carefully kept  
were both burst in the grand leap that made 
him victor      i was certain he had no other 
shoes  boot  or gaiters      if any one had 
money  who had the effrontery to offer it to 
the poet   

this same writer  becoming intimate with 
the poet  made several visits to fordham  
   the autumn came   he resumes   and mrs  
poe sank rapidly in consumption  and i saw 
her in her bedchamber  everything here 
was so neat  so purely clean  so scant and pov  
erty stricken        there was no clothing on 
the bed  which was only straw  but a snow  
white spread and sheets  the weather was 
cold  and the sick lady had the dreadful chills  
that accompany the hectic fever of consump  
tion  she lay on the straw bed  wrapped in 
her husband s greatcoat  with a large tortoise  
shell cat in her bosom  the wonderful cat 
seemed conscious of her great usefulness  the 
coat and the cat were the sufferer s only 
means of warmth  except as her husband held 
her hands  and her mother her feet  mrs  
clemm was passionately fond of her daughter  
and her distress on account of her illness  and 
poverty  and misery  dreadful to see  

 as soon as i was made aware of these pain  
ful facts i came to new york  and enlisted the 
sympathies and services of a lady whose heart 
and hand were ever open to the poor and the 
miserable        the lady headed a subscrip  



memoir     

tion  and carried them sixty dollars the next 
week  from the day this kind lady first saw 
the suffering family of the poet  she watched 
over them as a mother  she saw them often  
and ministered to the comfort of the dying 
and the living  this same generous lady  
who  we believe  was mrs  lewis  better 
known as   stella   subsequently  when the 
poet died  received mrs  clemm into her own 
house  and sheltered her until she could re  
turn to her friends in the south    the author 
of these  reminiscences  concludes    poe 
has been called a bad man  he was his own 
enemy  it is true  but he was a gentleman and 
a scholar      if the scribblers who have 
snapped like curs at his remains had seen him 
as his friends saw him  in his dire necessity 
and his great temptation  they would have 
been worse than they deem him to have writ  
ten as they have concerning a man of whom 
they really knew next to nothing   

when this writer brought the heartrending 
statement of the poor proud and unhappy 
poet s circumstances without poe s knowl  
edge or connivance before the world  willis  
in an article in the home journal  made an 
appeal to the public on the poet s behalf  sug  
gesting  at the same time  that his case was a 
strong argument in favor of the establishment 
of an hospital for poor but well educated per  
sons   his remarks are worth repetition  he 
says   the feeling we have long entertained 
on this subject has been freshened by a recent 
paragraph in the express announcing that 



   memoir  

mr  edgar allan poe and his wife were both 
dangerously ill and suffering for want of the 
common necessaries of life  here is one of the 
finest scholars  one of the most original men 
of genius  and one of the most industrious of 
the literary profession of our country  whose 
temporary suspension of labor  from bodily 
illness  drops him immediately to a level with 
the common objects of public charity  there 
is no intermediate stopping place no respect  
ful shelter where  with the delicacy due to 
genius and culture  he might secure aid  unad  
vertised  till  with returning health  he could 
resume his labors and his unmortified sense of 
independence  he must either apply to indi  
vidual friends  a resource to which death is 
sometimes almost preferable   or suffer down 
to the level where charity receives claimants  
but where rags and humiliation are the only 
recognized ushers to her presence  is this 
right  should there not be in all highly 
civilized communities an institution designed 
expressly for educated and refined objects of 
charity an hospital  a retreat  a home of 
seclusion and comfort  the sufficient claims to 
which would be such susceptibilities as are vio  
lated by the above mentioned appeal in a daily 
paper   

this noble and suggestive article of mr  
willis  griswold maliciously avers  was but an 
 ingenious apology for mr  poe s infirmities   
and then declares that the following letter  
which was written just before mrs  poe s 
death   was written for effect   



memoir     

 my dear willis the paragraph which has been 
put in circulation respecting my wife s illness  my own  
my property  etc   is now lying before me  together 
with the beautiful lines by mrs  locke and those by 

mrs    to which the paragraph has given rise  as 

well as your kind and manly comments in the home 
journal  the motive of the paragraph i leave to the 
conscience of him or her who wrote it or suggested it  
since the thing is done  however  and since the con  
cerns of my family are thus pitilessly thrust before the 
public  i perceive no mode of escape from a public 
statement of what is true and what is erroneous in the 
report alluded to  that my wife is ill  then  is true   
and you may imagine with what feelings i add  that 
this illness  hopeless from the first  has been heightened 
and precipitated by her reception  at two different 
periods of anonymous letters one enclosing the para  
graph now in question  the other those published calum  
nies of messrs    for which i yet hope to find 

redress in a court of justice  

 of the facts  that i myself have been long and dan  
gerously ill  and that my illness has been a well under  
stood thing among my brethren of the press  the 
best evidence is afforded by the innumerable para  
graphs of personal and of literary abuse with which i 
have been latterly assailed  this matter  however  will 
remedy itself  at the very first blush of my new pros  
perity  the gentlemen who toadied me in the old will 
recollect themselves and toady me again        that i 
am  without friends  is a gross calumny  which i am 
sure you never could have believed  and which a thou  
sand noble hearted men would have good right never to 
forgive for permitting to pass unnoticed and undented  
i do not think  my dear willis  that there is any need of 
my saying more  i am getting better  and may add  if 
it be any comfort to my enemies  that i have little fear 
of getting worse  the trufch is i have a great deal to 
do  and i have made up my mind not to die till it is 
done     sincerely yours  

 edgar a  poe  

 december            

animadverting upon this letter  the implac  



   memoir  

able griswold asserts  notwithstanding the 
positive evidence to the contrary  that poe 
 had not been ill a great while  nor danger  
ously at all   that there was no literary or per  
sonal abuse of him in the journals   and that 
his friends had been applied to for money until 
their money was nearly exhausted   as 
already stated  a few weeks after this letter  
which this calumniator of the dead declares 
 was written for  effect   the poet s wife died  
and in an autographic letter now before us  
poe positively reiterates the accusation that 
his wife   my poor virginia  was continually 
tortured  although not deceived  by anony  
mous letters  and on her deathbed declared 
that her life had been shortened by their 
writer   in january        the poet s darling 
wife died  and on a desolate dreary day her 
remains were interred in a vault in the neigh  
borhood  in accordance with the permission of 
its owner  the loss of his wife threw poe into 
a melancholy stupor which lasted for several 
weeks  but nature reasserting her powers  he 
gradually resumed his wonted avocations  
during the whole of the year the poet lived a 
quiet secluded life with his mother in law  
receiving occasional visits from his friends and 
admirers   musing over the memory of his lost 
lenore  and thinking out the great and crown  
ing work of his life eureka  an english 
friend  who visited the fordham cottage in 
early autumn of       and spent several weeks 
with its inmates  described to mrs  whitman 
its unrivaled neatness and the quaint simplic  



memoir     

ity of its interior and surroundings  it was  
at the time  bordered by a flower garden  whose 
clumps of rare dahlias  and brilliant beds of 
autumnal flowers  showed  in the careful cul  
ture bestowed upon them  the fine floral tastes 
of the presiding spirit  

the attention which poe gave to his birds 
and flowers surprised his visitor  who deemed 
it inconsistent with the gloom of his writings  
another friend  who visited the cottage dur  
ing the summer of the same year  describes it 
as  half buried in fruit trees  and as having a 
thick grove of pines in its immediate neighbor  
hood     the proximity of the railroad  and 
the increasing population of the little village   
adds mrs  whitman   have since wrought 
great changes in the place  round an old 
cherry tree  near the door  was a broad bank 
of greenest turf  the neighboring beds of 
mignonette and heliotrope  and the pleasant 
shade above  made this a favorite seat  rising 
at four o clock in the morning  for a walk to 
the magnificent aqueduct bridge over harlem 
river  our informant found the poet  with his 
mother in law  standing on the turf beneath 
the cherry tree  eagerly watching the move  
ments of two beautiful birds that seemed con  
templating a settlement in its branches  he 
had some rare tropical birds in cages  which 
he cherished and petted with assiduous care   
 our english friend   continued mrs  whit  
man   described poe as giving to his birds and 
flowers a delighted attention which seemed 
quite inconsistent with the gloomy and gro  

  poe s poenjs 



   memoir  

tesque character of his writings  a favorite 
cat  too  enjoyed his friendly patronage  and 
often when he was engaged in composition it 
seated itself on his shoulder  purring as if in 
complacent approval of the work proceeding 
under its supervision  

 during poe s residence at fordham  a walk 
to high bridge was one of his favorite and 
habitual recreations      remarks mrs  whitman  
and she describes the lofty and picturesque 
avenue across the aqueduct  where  in  the 
lonesome latter years  of his life  the poet was 
accustomed to walk  at all times of the day 
and night  often pacing the then solitary path  
way for hours without meeting a human 
being      a rocky ledge in the neighborhood  
partly covered with pines and cedars  and com  
manding a fine view of the surrounding coun  
try  was also one of his favorite resorts  and 
here  resumes our informant   through long 
summer days  and through solitary starlit 
nights  he loved to sit  dreaming his gorgeous 
walking dreams  or pondering the deep prob  
lems of  the universe   that grand  prose 
poem  to which he devoted the last and most 
matured energies of his wonderful intellect      
towards the close of this  most immemorial 
year   this year in which he had lost his cousin 
bride  he wrote his weird monody of  ula  
lume    like so many of his poems it was 
autobiographical  and  on the poet s own au  
thority  we are informed that it was   in its 
basis  although not in the precise correspond  
ence of time  simply historical   it first 



memoir     

appeared anonymously in col ton s american 
review for december        as  ulalume  a 
ballad   and  being reprinted in the home 
journal  by an absurd mistake was ascribed to 
the editor  n  p  willis  subsequently  mrs  
whitman  being one morning with poe in the 
providence athenaeum library  asked him if 
he had seen the new poem  and if he could tell 
who had written it  to her surprise he 
acknowledged himself the author  and  turn  
ing to a bound volume of the review  which 
was on a shelf near by  he wrote his name at 
the end of the poem  and there  a few months 
ago  a correspondent found it  the poem 
originally possessed an additional verse  but  
at the suggestion of mrs  whitman  poe sub  
sequently omitted this  and thereby greatly 
strengthened the effect of the whole  the 
final and suppressed stanza read thus   

 said we then the two  then ah  can it 
have been that the woodlandish ghouls 
the pitiful  the merciful ghouls 

to bar up our path and to ban it

had drawn up the specter of a planet 
from the limbo of lunary souls 

this sinfully scintillant planet 
from the hell of the planetary souls   

early in       poe announced his intention 
of delivering a series of lectures  with a view 
to raise a sufficient capital to enable him to 
start a magazine of his own  in january of 
this year he thus wrote on the subject to his 
old and tried friend n  p willis  



   memoir  

 fordham  january           

 mv dear mr  willis i am about to make an effort 
at re establishing myselt in the literary world  and feel 
that i may depend upon your aid  

 my general aim is to  start a magazine  to be called 
the stylus   but it would   be useless to me  even when 
established  if not entirely out of the control of a pub  
lisher    mean  therefore  to get up a journal  which 
shall be my own  at all points  with this ei d in view  
i must get a list of at least five hundred subscribers to 
begin with nearly two hundred i have already  i pro  
pose  however  to go south and west  among my per  
sonal and literary friends old college and west point 
acquaintances and see what i can do  in order to get 
the means of taking the first step  i propose to lecture at 
the society library  on thursday  the  d of february 
and  that there may be no cause of squabbling  my 
subject shall not be literary at all i have chosen a 
broad text  the universe   

 having thus given you the facts of the case  i leave 
all the rest to the suggestions of your o   n tlact and gen  
erosity  gratef ully most gratetidly  you r friend always  

 edcar a  poe   

this letter was speedily followc d by a pros  
pectus  addressed to the public   the stylus  
a monthly journal of literature proper  the 
fine arts  and the drama  to be edited 
by edgar a  poe   and from it the most 
noticeable paragraphs are extracted     since 
resigning the conduct of the southern literary 
messenger at the beginning of its third year  
and more especially since retiring from the 
editorship of graham s magazine soon after 
the commencement of its second  i have had 
always in view the establishment of a monthly 
journal which should retain one or two of the 
chief features of the work first mentioned  
abandoning or greatly modifying its general 



memoir     

character  but not until now have i felt at 
liberty to attempt the execution of this design  
i shall be pardoned for speaking more directly 
of the two magazines in question  having in 
neither of them any proprietary right the 
objects of their worthy owners  too  being at 
variance with my own i found it not only 
impossible to effect anything  on the score of 
taste  for their mechanical appearance  but 
difficult to stamp upon them internally that 
individuality which i believed essential to their 
success  in regard to the permanent influence 
of such publications  it appears to me that con  
tinuity and a marked certainty of purpose are 
requisites of vital importance  but attainable 
only where one mind alone has at least the 
general control  experience  to be brief  has 
shown me that in founding a journal of my 
own  lies my sole chance of carrying out to 
completion whatever peculiar intentions i may 
have entertained  

 these intentions are now as heretofore  it 
shall be the chief purpose of the magazine 
proposed to become known as one wherein 
may be found at all times  on all topics within 
its legitimate reach  a sincere and fearless 
opinion  it shall be a leading object to assert 
in precept and to maintain in practice the 
rights  while in effect it demonstrates the 
advantages  of an absolutely independent crit  
icisma criticism self sustained  guiding itself 
only by intelligible laws of art  analyzing 
these laws as it applies them  holding itself 



   memoir  

aloof from all personal bias  and acknowledg  
ing no fear save that of the right  

   there is no design  however  to make the 
journal a critical one solely  or even very es  
pecially  it will aim at something more than 
the usual magazine variety  and at affording a 
fair field for the true talent of the land  with  
out reference to the mere prestige cf name  or 
the advantages of worldly wisdom  but since 
the efficiency of the work must in great meas  
ure depend upon its definiteness  the stylus 
will limit itself to literature proper  the fine 
arts  and the drama   

notwithstanding the large number of his 
admirers  and the friendly co operation of mr  
thomas c  clark  who was to have been the 
publisher  poe found the minimum number of 
subscribers necessary to start the magazine 
very difficult to obtain  he therefore set about 
his lectures for the purpose of getting    the 
means of taking the first step   

the first lecture of the series was given in 
the library of the new york historical soci  
ety  it was upon the cosmogony of the 
universe  and formed the substance of the 
work he afterwards published as  eureka  a 
prose poem   mr  m  b  field  who was 
present  says  it was a stormy night  and 
there were not more than sixty persons pres  
ent in the lecture room        his lecture was 
a rhapsody of the most intense brilliancy  he 
appeared inspired  and his inspiration affected 
the scant audience almost painfully  his eyes 
seemed to glow like those of his own   raven  



memoir     

and he kept us entranced for two hours and a 
half   such small audiences  despite the en  
thusiasm of the lecturer  or the lectured  could 
not give much material aid towards the poet s 
purpose  poor and baffled he had to return to 
his lonely home at fordham  to contemplate 
anew the problems of creation   or to discuss 
with stray visitors  with an intensity of feel  
ing and steadfastness of belief never surpassed  
his unriddling of the secret of the universe  

in the early summer of      we find poe 
delivering a lecture at lowell on the   female 
poets of america    in an analysis of the 
comparative merits of the new england poet  
esses   says the hon  james atkinson  who 
attended the lecture   the lecturer awarded 
to mrs  osgood the palm of facility  ingenuity  
and grace   to mrs  whitman  a pre eminence 
in refinement of art  enthusiasm  imagination  
and genius  properly so called   to miss lynch 
he ascribed an unequaled success in the con  
centrated and forcible enunciation of the senti  
ment of heroism and duty   mrs  whitman  
undoubtedly the finest female poet new eng  
land has produced  had been first seen by poe  
says griswold   on his way from boston  when 
he visited that city to deliver a poem before 
the lyceum there  restless near midnight  he 
wandered from his hotel near where she lived  
until he saw her walking in a garden  he 
related the incident afterwards in one of his 
most exquisite poems  worthy of himself  of 
her  and of the most exalted passion   

 meanwhile  the beautiful young widow 



   memoir  

lived on perfectly unconscious of the fierce 
flame she had aroused in the poet s heart  
until  in the beginning of the summer of       
about the time of the above lecture  the first 
intimation reached her in the shape of the 
beautiful lines   to helen  alluded to by gris  
wold  commencing   i saw thee once once 
only years ago    there was no signature to 
the poem  but the lady was acquainted with 
edgar poe s exquisite handwriting  and there  
fore knew whence it came  about this time 
the poet went to richmond  virginia  and 
forming the acquaintance of the late mr  
james thompson  the talented editorial pro  
prietor of the southern literary messenger  
agreed to become a contributor to its pages  
mr  thompson  like all who knew poe person  
ally  became strongly attached to him  and 
has left some interesting reminiscences of him  
the poet at this period was making many in  
quiries about mrs  whitman  and speaking 
both publicly and privately in high praise of 
her poetry  so that at last  even before they 
met  their names were  as griswold truthfully 
states  frequently associated together  one 
day  says mr  thompson  poe rushed into the 
office of the messenger in a state of great ex  
citement  sat down and wrote out a challenge 
to mr  daniels  editor of the richmond exam  
iner  and requested mr  thompson to be its 
bearer to the person challenged   in explana  
tion of his conduct  he handed his friend a 
paragraph cut from the examiner  giving an 
account of poe s presumed engagement to 



memoir  si 

mrs  whitman  and making   some comments 
on the lady s temerity  the enraged poet 
said he did not care what daniels might say 
about him  but that he would net have the 
lady s name dragged in  mr  thompson re  
fused to deliver the challenge  and poe went 
personally to see daniels  and the result was 
that the offending paragraph was withdrawn  
in september of this year  poe  having ob  
tained a letter of introduction from a lady 
friend  sought and obtained an interview with 
mrs  whitman  the result of this and several 
subsequent interviews  was the betrothal of the 
two poets  notwithstanding the most strenu  
ous opposition of the lady s family  much as 
she revered his genius  the opposition of her 
relatives to the match appears for a time to 
have caused the lady to withstand the poet s 
passionate appeals  but ultimately  as stated  
they were engaged  the following para  
graphs  from a letter written by poe on the i th 
of october of this year  show how intensely he 
could feel  and how earnestly he could express 
his feelings as well in private correspondence 
as in those compositions intended for the 
public eye   

  you do not love me  or you would 
have felt too thorough a sympathy with the 
sensitiveness of my nature  to have wounded 
me as you have done with this terrible passage 
of your letter  how often i have heard it 
said of you   he has great intellectual power  
but no principle no moral sense   

   is it possible that such expressions as 



   memoir  

these could have been repeated to me to me 
by one whom i loved ah  whom i love       

   by the god who reigns in heaven  i swear 
to you that my soul is incapable of dishonor 
that  with the exception of occasional follies 
and excesses  which i bitterly lament  but to 
which i have been driven by intolerable sor  
row  and which are hourly committed by 
others without attracting any notice whatever 
i can call to mind no act of my life which 
would bring a blush to my cheek or to yours  
if i have erred at all  in this regard  it has 
been on the side of what the world would call 
a quixotic sense of the honorable of the chiv  
alrous  the indulgence of this sense has been 
the true voluptuousness of my life  it was for 
this species of luxury that in early youth i de  
liberately threw away from me a large fortune 
rather than endure a trivial wrong  

   for nearly three years i have been ill  
poor  living out of the world  and thus  as i 
now painfully see  have afforded opportunity 
to my enemies to slander me in private society 
without my knowledge  and thus  with im  

f unity  althoughmuch  however  may  and  
now see  must  have been said to my dis  
credit during my retirement  those few who  
knowing me well  have been steadfastly my 
friends  permitted nothing to reach my ears 
unless in one instance  of such a character that 
i could appeal to a court of justice for redress   
    i replied to the charge fully in a public 

the dunn english libel  see  ante  p       ed  



memoir     

newspaper afterwards suing the mirror   in 
which the scandal appeared    obtaining a verdict 
and receiving such an amount of damages as 
for the time to completely break up that jour  
nal  and do you ask why men so misjudge 
me why i have enemies  if your knowledge 
of my character and of my career does not 
afford you an answer to the query  at least it 
does not become me to suggest the answer  
let it suffice that i have had the audacity to 
remain poor  that i might preserve my inde  
pendence that  nevertheless  in letters  to a 
certain extent  and in certain regards  i have  
been  successful   that i have been a critic 
an unscrupulously honest  and  no doubt  in 
many cases  a bitter one that i have uni  
formly attacked where i attacked at all 
those who stood highest in power and influ  
ence  and that  whether in literature or soci  
ety  i have seldom refrained from expressing  
either directly or indirectly  the pure contempt 
with which the pretensions of ignorance  arro  
gance  or imbecility inspire me  and you 
who know all this  you ask me why i have 
enemies        forgive me if there be bitter  
ness in my tone         

the man who could write thus  it is impos  
sible not to feel  must have been sincere   must 
have been incapable of committing the mean  
the dishonoring actions  placed by an envi  
ous and jealous writer to his charge

in the very month this letter was written 
poe s engagement with mrs  whitman came 
to an end  the real cause of the rupture be  
tween the poet and his betrothed has never 
been published  although it is to be hoped 
that  for the sake of the much slandered dead  
the seal of silence will some day be broken  
it is impossible to impute blame to either of 
the parties concerned  as undoubtedly the true 
cause of the separation arose from circum  
stances beyond their control  according to the 
diabolical story told by griswold  and since re  
peated in nearly every memoir of the poet  on 
the evening before what should have been 
the bridal morn  poe committed such druaken 
outrages at the house of his affianced bride that 
it was fo ind necessary to summon the police 
to eject him  which of course ended the en  
gagement  this misstatement being brought 
under the notice of the parties concerned  mr  
pabodie wrote a direct and specific denial of it 
to the new york tribune  and it appeared in 
that paper on the  th of june         i am 
authorized to say    remarks mr  pabodie  who  
it should be mentioned  was an eminent law  
yer as well as a man of considerable literary 



   memoir  

ability    i am authorized to say  not only from 
my personal knowledge  but also from the 
statement of all who were conversant with the 
affair  that there exists not a shadow of foun  
dation for the story above alluded to   the 
same letter goes on to state that its writer 
knew poe well  and at the time alluded to was 
with him daily   i was acquainted with the 
circumstances of his engagement  and with 
the causes which led to its dissolution   con  
tinues mr  pabodie   and he concludes his let  
ter with an earnest appeal to griswold to do 
all that now lies in his power  to remove an 
undeserved stigma from the memory of the 
departed   an honorable man would have 
acknowledged the incorrectness of his informa  
tion  and have done his best to obviate the 
consequences of his accusation  not so this 
biographer   he wrote a savage letter to mr  
pabodie  threatening terrible things if he did 
not withdraw his statement  mr  pabodie did 
not withdraw  but  in another letter to gris  
wold  brought forward incontrovertible proofs 
of other falsifications indulged in by the author 
of the  memoir   who henceforward remained 
discreetly silent  

during the larger portion of       poe con  
tinued his studies  which at this period were 
chiefly philosophical  at his home at fordham  
beyond a few reviews  he would appear to 
have given his whole time to the completion 
of  eureka   the last and grandest monument 
of his genius  the merits of this wonderful 
 prose poem  this is neither the time nor the 



memoir     

place to discuss  and it suffices now to point 
out that in all probability no other author ever 
flung such an intensity of feeling  or ever be  
lieved more steadfastly in the truth of his 
work  than did edgar pote in this attempted 
unriddling of the secret of the universe  he 
was wont to discuss the various knotty points 
of    eureka  with a startling eloquence that 
electrified his hearers into belief  he could 
not submit to hear the claims of his work dis  
cussed by unsympathetic and incompetent 
critics  and after it was published in book form  
and thus made general property  he addressed 
this thoroughly characteristic letter to mr  c  
f  hoffman  then editor of the literary world  
anent a flippant critique of    eureka  which 
had appeared in the columns of that publica  
tion  

 dear sir in your paper of july     i find some 
comments on  eureka   a late book of my own  and i 
know you too well to suppose for a moment that you 
will refuse me the privilege of a few words in reply  i 
feel even that i might safely claim from mr  hoffman 
the right which every author has  of replying to his 
critic tone for tone  that is to say  of answering your 
correspondent s flippancy by flippancy  and sneer by 
sneer  but  in the first place  i do not wish to disturb 
the  world   and in the second  i feel that i should never 
be done sneering in the present instance were i  once to 
begin  l amartine blames voltaire for the use which 
he made of misrepresentations  ruses  in his attacks on 
the priesthood   but our young students of theology do 
not seem to be aware that in defense  or what they fancy 
to be defense  of christianity  there is anything wrong in 
such gentlemanly peccadilloes as the deliberate perver  
sion of an author s text to say nothing of the minor 
indecora of reviewing a book without it  and without 
having the faintest suspicion of what it is about 



   memoir  

  you will understand that it is merely the misrepre  
sentations of the critique in question fx  which i claim 
the privilege of reply  the mere opinions of the writer 
can be of no consequence to me and   should imagine 
of very little to himself that is to say  if he knows 
himself personally as well as i have the honor of know  
ing him  the first misrepresentation is contained in 
this sentence  this letter is a keen burlesque on the 
aristotelian or baconian method of ascertaining truth  
both of which the writer ridicules and despises  and 
pours forth his rhapsodical ecstasies in a glorification of 
a third mode the noble art of guessing   what i 
really say is this   that there is no absolute certainty 
either in the aristotelian or baconian process   that for 
this reason nefther philosophy is so profound as it fan  
cies itself  and that neither has a right to sneer at that 



inductions or deductions  of which the processes are so 
shadowy as to escape our consciousness  elude our 
reason  or defy our capacity of expression    the second 
misrepresentation runs thus   the developments of 
electricity and the formation of stars and suns  lumi  
nous and non  luminous  moons and planets  with their 
rings  etc   is deduced  very much according to the 
nebular theory of laplace  from the principle pro  
pounded above   now  the impression intended to be 
made here upon the reader s mind by the   student of 
theology  is  evidently  that my theory may be all very 
well in its way  but that it is nothing but laplace over 
again with some modifications that he  the student of 
theology  cannot regard as at all important i have 
only to say that no gentleman can accuse me of the dis  
ingenuousness here implied  inasmuch as  having pro  
ceeded with my theory to that point at which laplace s 
theory meets it i then give laplace s theory in full  
with the expression of my firm conviction of its absolute 
truth at all points  the ground covered by the great 
french astronomer compares with that covered by my 
theory  as a bubble compares with the ocean on which it 
floats  nor has he the slightest allusion to  the principle 
propounded above   the principle of unity bemr the 



memoir     

source of all things the principle of gravity being 
merely the reaction of the divine act which irradiated 
all things from unity  in fact  no point of my theory 
has been even so much as alluded to by laplace    
have not considered it necessary here to speak of the 
astronomical knowledge displayed in the  stars and 
suns  of the student of theology  nor to hint that it 
would be better grammar to say that  development and 
formation  are  than that development and formation is  
the third misrepresentation lies in a foot note  where 
the critic says   further than this  mr  pbe s claim 
that he can account for the existence of all organized 
beings man included merely from those principles 
on which the origin and present appearance of suns and 
worlds are explained  must be set down as mere bold 
assertion  without a particle of evidence  in others 
words  we should term it arrant fudge    the perversion 
of this point is involved in a willful misapplication of 
the word  principles   i say  willful  because at page    
i am particularly carefully to distinguish between the 
principles proper attraction and repulsion and those 
merely resultant suborinciples which control the uni  
verse in detail  to these sub principles  swayed by the 
immediate spiritual influence of deity  i leave  without 
examination  all that which the student of theology so 
roundly asserts i account for on the principles which 
account for the constitution of suns  etc 

 were these  misrepresentations   is that the name 
for them   made for any less serious a purpose than 
that of branding my book as  impious   and myself as a 
 pantheist   a  polytheist   a pagan  or a god knows 
what  and  indeed  i care very little  so it be not a stu  
dent of theology    i would have permitted their dis  
honesty to pass unnoticed  through pure contempt for 
the boyishness  for the turn down shirt collarness of 
their tone   but  as it is  you will pardon me  mr  editor  
that i have been compelled to expose a  critic  who  
courageously perserving his own anonymousity  takes 
advantage of my absence from the city to misrepresent  
and thus vilify me  by nan

the winter of          and the spring of the 
latter year  poe passed at fordham  and during 
this time he is alleged to have written a book 
entitled phases of american literature  
mr  m  a  daly states that he saw the complete 
work  but the manuscript would seem to have 
disappeared  after poe s death the larger por  
tion of his papers passed through griswold s 
hands  and his manipulation of them will  
doubtless  account for all deficiencies and 



memoir     

shortcomings  in the summer  poe revisited 
richmond  and spent between two and three 
months there  during which time he delivered 
two lectures  in the exchange concert room  
on  the poetic principle   

 when in richmond   says mr  thompson  
 he made the office of the messenger a place 
of frequent resort  his conversation was 
always attractive  and at times very brilliant  
among modern authors his favorite was 
tennyson  and he delighted to recite from 
 the princess   the song   tears  idle tears  
and a fragment of which 

   when unto dying eyes 
the casement slowly grows a glimmering square      

he pronounced unsurpassed by any image 
expressed in writing   for mr  thompson  
whom he inspired with an affection similar to 
that with which he inspired all with whom he 
had personal dealings  he wrote a quantity of 
his sparkling and vivid  marginalia   as well 
as reviews of  stella   mrs  lewis  and of 
mrs  osgood  to his probity and general 
worth  mr  thompson  who undoubtedly saw 
more of him in his latter days than any person 
not a relative  bears affectionate testimony  
writing to mr  james wood davidson  in       
he remarks   two years ago i had a long 
conversation in florence with robert and 
elizabeth barrett browning concerning poe  
the two poets  like yourself  had formed an 
ardent and just admiration of the author of 
 the raven   and feel a strong desire to see 



   memoir  

his memory vindicated from moral aspersion   
unfortunately the vindication has been slower 
than the aspersion to make its way in the 
world  

the poet had not been long in richmond on 
this occasion of his final visit before it was 
rumored that he was engaged to the love of 
his youth  mrs  shelton  who was now a 
widow  he never alluded in any way to such 
an engagement to his friend mr  thompson  
intimate as he was with him  but there would 
appear to have been some truth in the report  
and on the news of poe s death mrs  shelton 
went into mourning for him  on the  th of 
october he left richmond by train  with the 
intention  it is supposed  of going to fordham 
to fetch mrs  clemm before his departure he 
complained to a friend of indisposition  of 
chilliness and exhaustion  but  notwithstand  
ing  determined to undertake the journey  
he left the train at baltimore  and some hours 
later was discovered in the street insensible  
how he had been taken ill no one really 
knows  and all the absurd reports circulated 
about his last moments were absolute inven  
tions  he was dying when found  and  being 
unknown  was taken at once to the hospital  
where he died on sunday the yth of october  
      of inflammation of the  brain  insensible  
it is supposed  to the last  the following day 
he was buried in the burial ground of west  
minster church  close by the grave of his 
grandfather  general david poe  no stone 
marks the spot where he lies  



memoir     

in telling the true story of this poet s life it 
is impossible to utterly ignore the fact a fact 
of which his enemies have made so much 
that towards the close of his melancholy career  
sorrow and chronic pecuniary embarrassment 
drove him to the use of stimulants  as afford  
ing the only procurable nepenthe for his 
troubles   a less delicate organization than 
his   remarks one of his acquaintances  
 might have borne without injury what to 
him was maddening    i have absolutely no 
pleasure in the stimulants in which i some  
times so madly indulge    he wrote some months 
before his death to a dear friend who tried to 
hold forth a saving hope   it has not been in 
the pursuit of pleasure that i have periled life 
and reputation and reason  it has been in 
the desperate attempt to escape from tortur  
ing memories memories of wrong and in  
justice and imputed dishonor from a sense of 
insupportable loneliness and a dread of some 
strange impending doom   there is no ne  
cessity for us to touch heavily upon this terrible 
trait in the character of edgar poe this sad 
sickening infirmity of his  lonesome latter 
years   his error  if such it may be styled 
the impulse which blindly impelled him to his 
destruction injured no one but himself  and 
certainly  no one before or since has suffered 
so severely in character in consequence of it  
burns  goethe  byron  and other children of 
genius have erred far worse than poe ever did  
inasmuch as their derelictions injured others  
but with them the world has dealt leniently  



   memoir  

accepting their genius as a compensation  
but for poor edgar poe  who wronged no one 
but himself  the world  misled greatly it is 
true as to his real character  has hitherto had 
no mercy  but the true story of his life has 
now been told   henceforth let him be judged 
justly   henceforth let his few errors be forgot  
ten  and to his name be assigned that place 
which is due to it in the glory roll of fame  

the history of edgar allan poe can scarcely 
be said to have ended with his life  two days 
after his death a cruel deprecatory notice of his 
life and works appeared in the new york trib  
une  and this notice  which was signed  lud  
wig   after declaring that the poet s decease 
 will startle many  but few will be grieved by 
it    as    he had few or no friends   proceeds 
to furnish a sketch of poe s life  taken pro  
fessedly from gris wold s  poets and poetry of 
america   thanks to n  p  willis  it trans  
pired that this notice was by griswold himself 
he was the pseudonymous  ludwig    the 
papers were immediately flooded with disproofs 
of this characterization of poe  and friend after 
friend came forward to defend the dead man 
against his assailant  willis led the van with 
his well known and already alluded to paper  
in which he recorded his own personal knowl  
edge of edgar poe  derived from five years  
intimate acquaintanceship  mr  george r  
graham  the originator and proprietor of the 
well known graham s magazine  next pro  
ceeded to denounce  in what griswold styles 
  a sophomorical and trashy  but widely circu  



memoir     

lated letter  the notice as  an immortal in  
famy   and probably knowing   better than any 
one else the position which his rival editors 
stood in with respect to one another  declared 
it to be the  fancy sketch of a perverted jaun  
diced vision    john neal also came forward 
to assert that it was  false and malicious   
and its author a  calumniator   between 
whom and poe existed  a long  intense  and 
implacable enmity   that utterly disqualified 
griswold for the post of the poet s biographer  
undaunted by the outcry he had created  gris  
wold proceeded to the manufacture of that 
masterpiece of envy  hatred  and malice  
which  under the title of a  memoir of edgar 
poe   he attempted to foist upon the world 
as a truthful life of america s greatest and 
most original genius  doubted  refuted  and 
condemned  as it has been in america  where 
griswold s own disreputable career was but 
too notorious to be ignored  the soi disant 
 memoir  still remains even there the only 
story of poe s life  whilst in europe it has been 
unwittingly and almost universally accepted 
as the truth  in france  indeed  it has been 
attacked by baudelaire  who pointed out its 
author s evident animosity to poe  and in 
england  mr  moy thomas drew attention to 
the fact that portraitures of poe  less repulsive 
than that given by griswold  were in exist  
ence   as a rule  however  it has been received 
as a faithful story  

in the preceding  memoir  an attempt has 
been made for the first time to do justice to the 



   memoir  

poet s memory  many of the dark stains 
which griswold cast upon it have been re  
moved  and those which remain  resting as 
they do solely upon the testimony of an im  
placable enemy  may safely be ignored as  in 
the mild words of mrs  whitman   perverted 
facts and baseless assumptions   

it does not come within the scope of our 
present purpose to investigate the peculiarities 
of poe s genius  or to analyze the varied excel  
lencies of his works  there are  however  
some misconceptions  with regard to his liter  
ary labors which  founded as they almost 
invariably are upon griswold s authority  we 
should like to draw attention to  says this 
biographer  and the remark has been fre  
quently copied  word for word   poe exhibits 
scarcely any virtue in either his life or his 
writings  probably there is not another in  
stance in the literature of our language in 
which so much has been accomplished without 
a recognition of a manifestation of con  
science   as regards poe s life  the world 
can now judge anew whilst  as regards his 
writings  we demand in what works of fiction 
are more fully recognized and more vividly 
portrayed the unappeasable tortures and the 
immutable punishments of conscience  than in 
such tales as  the man of the crowd    the 
tell tale heart   and  william wilson  
the very personification of conscience itself  
can any but wilful blindness affect to ignore 
such terrible examples of a high and unavoid  
able retribution  who  too  having read poe s 



memoir     

writings  can adopt gris wold s dictum that 
they  never display reverence or remorse   
no one ever expressed a greater  reverence  
for all that is truly great and noble than did 
poe  whilst  as for  remorse   it has yet to be 
proved that that was needed in his case  with 
griswold s mere opinion  that poe failed in 
everything he attempted  we have nothing to 
do  nor does it concern us that he deemed him 
 not remarkably original in invention   but 
when he proceeds to charge him with whole  
sale robbery  and avers that u some of his plag  
iarisms are scarcely parallel for their 
audacity   silence could not but be miscon  
strued  of the instances which the biographer 
gives of the alleged literary thefts of him 
whom he styles  this extraordinary creature   
we have already examined and disproved the 
two chief  the  conchology  and  the 
haunted palace  charges  and there only 
remains the accusation that  the complicate 
machinery upon which the interest depends  
of  the pit and the pendulum  is borrowed 
from a story entitled  vivenzio   which 
appeared in blackwood s magazine  this tale 
was published in august        and it is to be 
wished that any one placing the slightest reli  
ance upon griswold s credibility will compare 
the two  the only similarity being due to the 
fact that both stories derive from historical 
record the idea of a collapsing room  mr  mud  
ford s tale of  the iron shroud  does not bear 
the slightest resemblance in plot or treatment 
to poe s  

i foe s poems  



   memoir  

to support a general charge of inconsistency 
in poe s criticisms  the implacable biographer 
adduces two instances   the first  referring to 
mr  laughtoh osborn  has already been re  
futed in our account of poe s connection with 
the literary messenger  and the second  relat  
ing to mr  william a  jones  it is quite as easy 
to disprove  in this latter instance  griswold 
gives a short extract from a paper on    critics 
and criticism   in which poe awards a few 
words ot lukewarm praise to mr  jones  and 
in opposition to this he then quotes a few 
garbled sentences from the broadway journal  
in which the same writer is condemned in no 
very measured terms  the story is too long 
and too uninteresting for recapitulation  but 
those who are sufficiently curious to learn the 
whole truth can find it in full at pages     
and     of the second volume of the above 
journal  it suffices to say that poe s published 
opinion of mr  jones was consistently alike 
upon the two occasions referred to  but it is 
as unnecessary as it is distasteful to pursue this 
subject further   we have said enough to prove 
the unreliability of griswold s  memoir of 
edgar poe   and in conclusion will content 
ourselves with reproducing mr  graham s in  
teresting and oft referred to letter  as the val  
uable and unbiased evidence of an unimpeach  
able witness  the employer of both poe and 
griswold  it appears in graham s magazine 
for march        

 mv dear willis  in an article of yours  
which accompanies the two beautiful volumes 



memoir      

of the writings of edgar allan poe  you have 
spoken with so much truth and delicacy of the 
deceased  and with the magical touch of genius 
have called so warmly up before me the mem  
ory of our lost friend  as you and i both seem 
to have known him  that i feel warranted in 
addressing to you the few plain words i have 
to say in defense of his character as set down 
by mr  griswold  although the article  it 
seems  appeared originally in the new york 
tribune  it met my eye for the first time in the 
volumes before me  i now purpose to take 
exception to it in the most public manner  i 
knew mr  poe well far better than mr  gris  
wold   and by the memory of old times  when 
he was an editor of   graham   i pronounce 
this exceedingly ill timed and unappreciative 
estimate of the character of our lost friend 
unfair and untrue  it is mr  poe  as seen by 
the writer while laboring under a fit of the 
nightmare  but so dark a picture has no re  
semblance to the living man  accompanying 
these beautiful volumes  it is an immortal 
the death s head over the entrance to the gar  
den of beauty a horror that clings to the 
brow of morning  whispering of murder  it 
haunts the memory through every page of his 
writings  leaving upon the heart a sensation 
of utter gloom  a feeling almost of terror  
the only relief we feel is in knowing that it is 
not true that it is a fancy sketch of a per  
verted  jaundiced vision  the man who could 
deliberately say of edgar allan poe  in a 
notice of his life and writings  prefacing the 



    memoir  

volumes which were to become a priceless 
souvenir to all who loved him that his death 
might startle many   but that few would be 
grieved by it  and blast the whole fame of 
the man by such a paragraph as follows  is a 
judge dishonored  he is not mr  poe s peer  
and i challenge him before the country  even 
as a juror in the case  

   his harsh experience had deprived him of all faith 
in man or woman  he had made up his mind upon the 
numberless complexities of the social world  and the 
whole system with him was an imposture  this con  
viction gave a direction to his shrewd and naturally 
unamiable character  still  though he regarded society 
as composed altogether of villains  the sharpness of his 
intellect was not of that kind which enabled him to cope 
with villainy while it continually caused him by over  
shots to fail of the success of honesty  he was in many 
respects like francis vivian in bulwer s novel of  the 
caxtons   passion  in him  comprehended many of the 
worst emotions which militate against human happi  
ness  you could not contradict him  but you raised 
quick choler   you could not speak of wealth  but his 
cheek paled with gnawing envy  the astonishing nat  
ural advantages of this poor boy his beauty  his read  
iness  the daring spirit that breathed around him like a 
fiery atmosphere had raised his constitutional self con  
fidence into an arrogance that turned his very claims to 
admiration into prejudices against him  irascible  
envious bad enough  but not the worst  for these salient 
angles were all varnished over with a cold repellant 
cynicism  his passions vented themselves in sneers  
there seemed to him no more susceptibility   and what 
was more remarkable in a proud nature  little or nothing 
of the true point of honor  he had  to a morbid excess  
that desire to rise which is vulgarly called ambition  but 
no wish for the esteem or the love of the species   only 
the hard wish to succeed not shine  nor serve suc  
ceed  that he might have the right to despise a world 
which galled his self conceit    



memoir      

 now  this is dastardly  and what is worse  
it is false  it is very adroitly done  with 
phrases very well turned  and with gleams of 
truth shining out from a setting so dusky as 
to look devilish  mr  griswold does not feel 
the worth of the man he has undervalued he 
had no sympathies in common with him  and 
has allowed old prejudices and old enmities to 
steal  insensibly perhaps  into the coloring of 
his picture  they were for years totally un  
congenial  if not enemies  and during that 
period mr  poe  in a scathing lecture upon 
 the poets of america  gave mr  griswold 
some raps over the knuckles of force sufficient 
to be remembered  he had  too  in the exer  
cise of his functions as critic  put to death 
summarily the literary reputation of some of 
mr  griswold s best friends  and their ghosts 
cried in vain for him to avenge them during 
poe s lifetime and it almost seems as if the 
present hacking at the cold remains of him 
who struck them down is a sort of compensa  
tion for duty long delayed for reprisal long 
desired but deferred    but without this the 
opportunities afforded mr  griswold to esti  
mate the character of poe occurred  in the 
main  after his stability had been wrecked  his 
whole nature in a degree changed  and with 
all his prejudices aroused and active  nor do 
i consider mr  griswold competent with all 
the opportunities he may have cultivated or 
acquired to act as his judge to dissect that 
subtle and singularly fine intellect to probe 
the motives and weigh the actions of that 



    memoir  

proud heart  his whole nature that distinc  
tive presence of the departed which now stands 
impalpable  yet in strong outline before me  
as i knew him and felt him to be eludes the 
rude grasp of a mind so warped and uncon  
genial as mr  griswold s  

 but it may be said  my dear willis  that 
mr  poe himself deputed him to act as his 
literary executor  and that he must have felt 
some confidence in his ability at least if not 
in his integrity to perform the functions im  
posed with discretion and honor  i do not 
purpose  now  to enter into any examination 
of the appo intment of mr  griswold nor of 
the wisdom of his appointment to the solemn 
trust of handing the fair fame of the deceased 
unimpaired to that posterity to which the 
dying poet bequeathed his legacy but simply 
to question its faithful performance  among 
the true friends of poe in this city and he 
had some such here there are those i am sure 
that he did not class among villains   nor did 
they feel easy when they see their old friend 
dressed out  in his grave  in the habiliments 
of a scoundrel  there is something to them  
in this mode of procedure on the part of the 
literary executor  that does not chime in with 
their notions of  the true point of honor    they 
had all of them looked upon our departed 
friend as singularly indifferent to wealth for 
its own sake  but as very positive in his opin  
ions that the scale of social merit was not of 
the highest that mind  somehow  was apt to 
be left out of the estimate altogether and 



memoir      

partaking somewhat of his free way of think  
ing  his friends are startled to find they have 
entertained very unamiable convictions  as 
to his  quick choler  when he was contradicted  
it depended a good deal upon the party deny  
ing  as well as upon the subject discussed  he 
was quick  it is true  to perceive mere quacks 
in literature  and somewhat apt to be hasty 
when pestered with them  but upon most 
other questions his natural amiability was not 
easily disturbed  upon a subject that he un  
derstood thoroughly he felt some right to be 
positive  if not arrogant  when addressing pre  
tenders  his  astonishing natural advantages  
had been very assiduously cultivated his 
daring spirit was the anointed of genius his 
self confidence the proud conviction of both 
and it was with something of a lofty scorn that 
he attacked  as well as repelled  a crammed 
scholar of the hour  who attempted to palm 
upon him his ill digested learning  literature 
with him was religion  and he  its high priest  
with a whip of scorpions scourged the money  
changers from the temple  in all else he had 
the docility and kind heartedness of a child  
no man was more quickly touched by a kind  
ness none more prompt to atone for an in  
jury  for three or four years i knew him 
intimately  and for eighteen months saw him 
almost daily   much of the time writing or 
conversing at the same desk   knowing all his 
hopes  his fears  and little annoyances of life  
as well as his high hearted struggle with ad  
verse fate yet he was always the same pol  



    memoir  

ished gentleman the quiet unobtrusive  
thoughtful scholar the devoted husband 
frugal in his personal expenses punctual and 
unwearied in his industry and the soul of 
honor in all his transactions  this  of course  
was in his better days  and by them we judge 
the man  but even after his habits had 
changed  there was no literary man to whom i 
would more readily advance money for labor 
to be done  he kept his accounts  small as 
they were  with the accuracy of a banker  i 
append an account sent to me in his own hand 
long after he had left philadelphia  and after 
all knowledge of the transactions it recited 
had escaped my memory  i had returned him 
the story of  the gold bug   at his own re  
quest  as he found that he could dispose of it 
very advantageously elsewhere  

   we were square when i sold you the  versi  
fication  article  for which you gave me first 
$    and afterwards $  in all $   oo 

then you bought the  gold bug  for         



  got both these back  so that i owed     $   oo 
you lent mrs  clemm

so i paid in all    oo 

which leaves still due by me       $      

 this  i find was his uniform habit with 
others as well as myself carefully recalling 
to mind his indebtedness  with the fresh ar  
ticle sent  and this is the man who had  no 
moral susceptibility   and little or nothing of 
the  true point of honor   it may be a very 
plain business view of the question  but it 
strikes his friends that it may pass as some  
thing as times go  

 t l shall never forget how solicitous of the 
happiness of his wife and mother in law he 
was  whilst one of the editors of graham s 
magazine his whole efforts seemed to be to 
procure the comfort and welfare of his home  
except for their happiness and the natural 
ambition of having a magazine of his own i 
never heard him deplore the want of wealth  
the truth is  he cared little for money  and 
knew less of its value  for he seemed to have 
no personal expenses  what he received from 
me in regular monthly installments went 
directly into the hands of his mother in law 
for family comforts and twice only i remem  
ber his purchasing some rather expensive lux  
uries for his house  and then he was nervous 
to the degree of misery until he had  by extra 
articles  covered what he considered an impru  
dent indebtedness  his love for his wife was 

$ foe s foems  



    memoir  

a sort of rapturous worship of the spirit of 
beauty which he felt was fading  before his 
eyes  i have seen him hovering around her 
when she was ill  with all the fond fear and 
tender anxiety of a mother of her first born 
her slightest cough causing him a shudder  a 
heart chill that was visible  i rode out one 
summer evening with them  and the remem  
brance of his watchful eyes  eagerly bent upon 
the slightest change of hue in that loved face  
haunts me yet as the memory of a sad strain  
it was this hourly anticipation of her loss that 
made him a sad and thoughtful man and lent 
a mournful melody to his undying song  

 it is true that later in life poe had much of 
those morbid feelings which a life of poverty 
and disappointment is so apt to engender in 
the heart of man the sense of having been 
ill used  misunderstood  and put aside by men 
of far less ability and of none  which preys 
upon the heart and clouds the brain of many a 
child of song   a consciousness of the inequali  
ties of life and of the abundant power of mere 
wealth allied even to vulgarity to over ride all 
distinctions  and to thrust itself bedaubed with 
dirt and glittering with tinsel into the high 
places of society  and the chief seats of the 
synagogue   whilst he  a worshiper of the beau  
tiful and true  who listened to the voices of 
angels  and held delighted companionship with 
them as the cold throng swept disdainfully by 
him  was often in danger of being thrust out 
houseless  homeless  beggared upon the world  
with all his fine feelings strung to a tension of 



memoir      

agony when he thought of his beautiful and 
delicate wife dying hourly before his eyes  
what wonder that he then poured out the 
vials of a long  treasured bitterness upon the 
injustice and hollowness of all society around 
him  

 the very natural question  wh   did he 
not work and thrive   is easily answered  it 
will not be asked by the many who know the 
precarious tenure by which literary men hold a 
mere living in this country  the avenues 
through which they can profitably reach the 
country are few  and crowded with aspirants 
for bread as well as fame  the unfortunate 
tendency to cheapen every literary work to the 
lowest point of beggarly flimsiness in price 
and profit prevents even the well disposed 
from extending anything like an adequate sup  
port to even a part of the great throng which 
genius  talent  education  and even misfortune 
force into the struggle  the character of 
poe s mind was of such an order as not to be 
very widely in demand  the class of educated 
mind which he could readily and profitably 
address was small the channels through 
which he could do so at all were few and 
publishers all  or nearly all  contented with such 
pens as were already engaged  hesitated to incur 
the expense of his to an extent which would 
sufficiently remunerate him   hence  when he 
was fairly at sea  connected permanently with 
no publication  he suffered all the horrors of 
prospective destitution  with scarcely the abil  
ity of providing for immediate necessities   and 



    memoir  

at such moments  alas   the tempter often came  
and as you have truly said   one glass  of wine 
made him a madman  let the moralist who 
stands upon  tufted carpet   and surveys his 
smoking board  the fruits of his individual toil 
or mercantile adventure  pause before he lets 
the anathema  trembling upon his lips  fall 
upon a man like poe  who  wandering from 
publisher to publisher  with his fine print like 
manuscript  scrupulously clean and neatly 
rolled  finds no market for his brain with 
despair at heart  misery ahead for himself and 
his loved ones  and gaunt famine dogging at 
his heels  thus sinks by the wayside  before 
the demon that watches his steps and whispers 
oblivion  of all the miseries which god  or 
his own vices  inflict upon man  none are so 
terrible as that of having the strong and will  
ing arm struck down to a child like inefficiency  
while the heart and will have the purpose 
and force of a giant s outdoing  we must re  
member  too  that the very organization of 
such a mind as that of poe the very tension 
and tone of his exquisitely strung nerves the 
passionate yearnings of his soul for the beauti  
ful and true  utterly unfitted him for the rude 
jostlings and fierce competitorship of trade  
the only drafts of his that could be honored 
were those upon his brain  the unpeopled 
air the caverns of ocean the decay and mys  
tery that hang around old castles the thunder 
of wind through the forest aisles the spirits 
that rode the blast  by all but him unseen 
an j the deep metaphysical creations which 



memoir      

floated through the chambers of his soul were 
his only wealth  the high change where only 
his signature was valid for rubies  

   could he have stepped down and chron  
icled small beer  made himself the shifting 
toady of the hour  and with bow and cringe hung 
upon the steps of greatness  sounding the glory 
of third rate ability with a penny trumpet  he 
would have been feted alive and perhaps been 
praised when dead  but no  his views of the 
duties of the critic were stern  and he felt that 
in praising an unworthy writer he committed 
dishonor  his pen was regulated by the high  
est sense of duty  by a keen analysis he sepa  
rated and studied each piece which the skillful 
mechanist had put together  no part  how  
ever insignificant  or apparently unimportant  
escaped the rigid and patient scrutiny of his 
sagacious mind  the unfitted joint proved the 
bungler the slightest blemish was a palpable 
fraud  he was the scrutinizing lapidary  who 
detected and exposed the most minute flaw 
in diamonds  the gem of first water shone the 
brighter for the truthful setting of his calm 
praise  he had the finest touch of soul for 
beauty a delicate and hearty appreciation of 
worth  if his praise appeared tardy  it was of 
priceless value when given  it was true as 
well as sincere  it was the stroke of honor 
that at once knighted the receiver  it was in 
the world of mind that he was king  and with 
a fierce audacity he felt and proclaimed him  
self autocrat  as critic he was despotic  
supreme  yet no man with more readiness 



    memoir  

would soften a harsh expression at the request 
of a friend  or if he himself felt that he had 
infused too great a degree of bitterness into 
his article  none would more readily soften it 
down after it was in type though still main  
taining the justness of his critical views  i do 
not believe that he wrote to give pain   but in 
combating what he conceived to be error  he 
used the strongest word that presented itself  
even in conversation  he labored not so 
much to reform as to exterminate error  and 
thought the shortest process was to pull it up 
by the roots  

 he was a worshiper of intellect longing 
to grasp the power of mind that moves the 
stars to bathe his soul in the dreams of ser  
aphs  he was himself all ethereal  of a fine 
essence  th it moved in an atmosphere of 
spirits of spiritual beauty overflowing and 
radiant twin brother with the angels  feeling 
their flashing wings upon his heart  and almost 
clasping them in his embrace  of them  and 
as an expectant archangel of that high order 
of intellect  stepping out of himself as it were  
and interpreting the time he reveled in deli  
cious luxury in a world beyond  with an audac  
ity which we fear in madmen  but in genius 
worship as the inspiration of heaven  

 but my object in throwing together a few 
thoughts upon the character of edgar allan 
poe was not to attempt an elaborate criticism  
but to say what might palliate grave faults 
that have been attributed to him  and to meet 
by facts unjust accusation in a word  to give 



memoir  ill 

a mere outline of the man as lie lived before 
me  i think i am warranted in saying to mr  
griswold  that he must review his decision  
it will not stand the calm scrutiny of his own 
judgment  or of time  while it must be re  
garded by all the friends of mr  poe as an ill  
judged and misplaced calumny upon that 
gifted son of genius

death of edgar a  poe  



by n  p  willis  



the ancient fable of two antagonistic spirits 
imprisoned in one body equally powerful and 
having the complete mastery by turns of one 
man that is to say  inhabited by both a devil 
and an angel seems to have been realized  if 
all we hear is true  in the character of the ex  
traordinary man whose name we have written 
above  our own impression of the nature of 
edgar a  poe differs in some important degree  
however  from that which has been generally 
conveyed in the notices of his death  let us  
before telling what we personally know of him  
copy a graphic and highly finished portraiture  
from the pen of dr  rufus w  griswoid  which 
appeared in a recent number of the tribune  

 edgar allan poe is dead  he died in baltimore on 
sunday  october  th  this announcement will startle 
many  but few will be grieved by it  the poet was 
known  personally or by reputation  in all this country   
he had readers in england  and in several of the states 
of continental europe   but he had few or no friends   
and the regrets for his death will be suggested princi  
pally by the consideration that in him literary art has 
lost one of its most brilliant but erratic stars         

 his conversation was at times almost super mortal 
in its eloquence  his voice was modulated with aston  
ishing skill  and his large and variably expressive eyes 
looked repose or shot fiery tumult into theirs who lis  
    



    death of edgar a  

tened  while his own face glowed  or was changeless in 
pallor  as his imagination quickened his blood or drew 
it back frozen to his heart  his imagery was from 
the worlds which no mortals can see but with the vision 
of genius  suddenly starting from a proposition  ex  
actly and sharply defined  in terms of utmost simplicity 
and clearness  he rejected the forms of customary logic  
and by a crystalline process of accretion  built up his 
ocular demonstrations in forms of gloomiest and ghast  
liest grandeur  or in those of the most airy and delicious 
beauty so minutely and distinctly  yet so rapidly  that 
the attention which was yielded to him was chained till 
it stood among his wonderful creations till he himself 
dissolved the spell  and brought his hearers back to com  
mon and base existence  by vulgar fancies or exhibitions 
of the ignoblest passion  

 he was at all times a dreamer dwelling in ideal 
realms in heaven or hell peopled with the creatures 
and the accidents of his brain  he walked the streets  
in madness or melancholy  with lips moving in indis  
tinct curses  or with eyes upturned in passionate prayer 
 never for himself  for he felt  or professed to feel  that 
he was already damned  but  for their happiness who at 
the moment were objects of his idolatry   or  with his 
glances introverted to a heart gnawed with anguish  
and with a face shrouded in gloom  he would brave the 
wildest storms   and all night   with drenched garments 
and arms beating the winds and rains  would speak as 
if to spirits that at such times only could be evoked by 
him from the aidenn  close by whose portals his dis  
turbed soul sought to forget the ills to which his aonsti  
tution subjected him close by the aidenn where were 
those he lovedc the aidenn which he might never see  
but in fitful glimpses  as its gates opened to receive the 
less fiery and more happy natures whose destiny to sin 
did not involve the doom of death  

 he seemed  except when some fitful pursuit subju  
gated his will and engrossed his faculties  always to 
bear the memory ot some controlling sorrow  the re  
markable poem of the raven was probably much more 
nearly than has been supposed  even by those who were 
very intimate with him  a reflection and an echo of his 
own history  he was that bird s 



death of edgar a  poe      

    unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster 

followed fast and followed faster till his songs one 

burden bore 

till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden 
bore 

of  never never more     

 every genuine author in a greater or less degree 
leaves in his works  whatever their design  traces of his 
personal character  elements of his immortal being  in 
which the individual survives the person  while we 
read the pages of the fall of the house of usher or of 
mesmeric revelations  we see in the solemn and stately 
gloom which invests one  and in the subtle metaphysical 
analysis of both  indications of the idiosyncrasies of 
what was most remarkable and peculiar in the author s 
intellectual nature  but we see here only the better 
phases of his nature  only the symbols of his juster ac  
tion  for his harsh experience had deprived him of all 
faith  in man or woman  he had made up his mind 
upon the numberless complexities of the social world  
and the whole system with him was on imposture  this 
conviction gave a direction to his shrewd and naturally 
unamiable character  still  though he regarded society 
as composed altogether of villains  the sharpness of his 
intellect was not of that kind which enabled him to cope 
with villainy  while it continually caused him by over  
shots to fail of the success of honesty  he was in many 
respects like francis vivian in bulwer s novel of  the 
caxtons   passion in him comprehended many of the 
worst emotions which militate against human happi  
ness  you could not contradict him  but you raised 
quick choler  you could not speak of wealth  but his 
cheek paled with gnawing envy  the astonishing 
natural advantages of this poor boy his beauty  his 
readiness  the daring spirit that breathed around him 
like a fiery atmosphere had raised his constitutional 
self confidence into an arrogance that turned his very 
claims to admiration into prejudices against him  iras  
cible  envious bad enough  but not the worst  for these 
salient angles were all varnished over with a cold  repel  
lent cynicism  his passions vented themselves in sneers  



    death of edgar a  poe  

there seemed to him no moral susceptibility   and  what 
was more remarkable in a proud nature  little or nothing 
cf the true point of honor  he had  to a morbid excess  
that desire to rise which is vulgarly called ambition  but 
no wish for the esteem or the love of his species  only 
the hard wish to succeed not shine  not serve succeed 
that he might have the right to despise a world which 
galled his self conceit  

 we have suggested the influence of his arms and 
vicissitudes upon his literature  it was more conspicu  
ous in his later than in his earlier writings  nearly all 
that he wrote in the last two or three years including 
much of his best poetry was in some sense biographi  
cal   in draperies of hi   imagination  those who had 
taken the trouble to trace his steps  eould perceive  but 
slightly concealed  the figure of himself   

apropos of the disparaging portion of the 
above well written sketch  let us truthfully 
say  

some four or five years since  when editing 
a daily paper in this city  mr  poe was em  
ployed by us  for several months  as critic and 
sub editor  this was our first personal ac  
quaintance with him  he resided with his 
wife and mother at fordham  a few miles out 
of town  but was at his desk in the office  from 
nine in the morning till the evening paper 
went to press  with the highest admiration 
for his genius  and a willingness to let it atone 
for more than ordinary irregularity  we were 
led by common report to expect a very capri  
cious attention to his duties  and occasionally 
a scene of violence and difficulty  time went 
on  however  and he was invariably punctual 
and industrious  with his pale  beautiful  
and intellectual face  as a reminder of what 



death of edgar a  poe      

genius was in him  it was impossible  of course  
not to treat him always with deferential 
courtesy  and  to our occasional request that 
he would not probe too deep in a criticism  or 
that he would erase a passage colored too 
highly with his resentments against society and 
mankind  he readily and courteously assented 
far more yielding than most men  we 
thought  on points so excusably sensitive  
with a prospect of taking the lead in another 
periodical  he at last voluntarily gave up his 
employment with us  and  through all this con  
siderable period  we had seen but one present  
ment of the man a quiet  patient  industrious  
and most gentlemanly person  commanding 
the utmost respect and good feeling by his 
unvarying deportment and ability  

residing as he did in the country  we never 
met mr  poe in hours of leisure   but he fre  
quently called on us afterward at our place of 
business  and we met him often in the street 
invariably the same sad mannered  winning  
and refined gentleman  such as we had always 
known him  it was by rumor only  up to the 
day of his death  that we knew of any other 
development of manner or character  we 
heard  from one who knew him well  what 
should be stated in all mention of his lament  
able irregularities   that  with a single glass of 
wine  his whole nature was reversed  the 
demon became uppermost  and  though none 
of the usual signs of intoxication were visible  
his will was palpably insane  possessing his 
reasoning faculties in excited activity  at such 



    death of edgar a  poe  

times  and seeking his acquaintances with his 
wonted look and memory  he easily seemed 
personating only another phase of his natural 
character  and was accused  accordingly  of 
insulting arrogance and bad heartedness  in 
this reversed character  we repeat  it was never 
our chance to see him  we know it from 
heresay  and we mention it in connection with 
this sad infirmity of physical constitution   
which puts it upon very nearly the ground of 
a temporary and almost irresponsible insanity  
the arrogance  vanity  and depravity of 
heart  of which mr  poewas generally accused  
seemed to us referrable altogether to this rev  
ersed phase of his character  under that 
degree of intoxication which only acted upon 
him by demonizing his sense of truth and 
right  he doubtless said and did much that was 
wholly irreconcilable with his better nature  
but  when himself  and as we knew him only  
his modesty and unaffected humility  as to his 
own deservings  were a constant charm to his 
character  his letters  of which the constant 
application for autographs has taken from us  
we are sorry to confess  the greater portion  
exhibited this quality very strongly  in one 
of the carelessly written notes of which we 
chance still to retain possession  for instance  
he speaks of  the raven  that extraordinary 
poem which electrified the world of imagina  
tive readers  and has become the type of a 
school of poetry of its own and  in evident 
earnest  attributes its success to the few words 
of commendation with which we had prefaced

it in this paper  it will throw light on his 
same character to give a literal copy of the 
note   

 fordham  april           

 mv dear willis  the poem which i enclose  and 
which i am so vain as to hope you will like in some 
respects  has been just published in a paper for which 
sheer necessity compels me to write  now and then  
it pays well as times go but unquestionably it ought 
to pay ten prices  for whatever i send it i feel i am 
consigning to the tomb of the capulets  the verses 
accompanying this  may i beg you to take out of the 
tomb  and bring them to light in the home journal  it 
you can oblige me so far as to copy them  i do not think 

it will be necessary to say   from the   that would 

be too bad  and  perhaps   from a late paper   

would do  

 i have not forgotten how a  good word in season  
from you made  the raven   and made  ulalume  
 which  by the way  people have done me the honor of 
attributing to you  therefore i would ask you  if i 
dared  to say something of these lines if they please 
you     truly yours ever  

 edgar a  poe   

in double proof of his earnest disposition 
to do the best for himself  and as the trustful 
and grateful nature which has been denied 
him we give another of the only three of his 
notes which we chance to retain   

 fordham  january           

 my dear mr  willis  i am about to make an 
effort at re establishing myself in the literary world  
and feel that i may depend upon your aid    

 my general aim is to start a magazine  to be called 
 the stylus   but it would be useless to me  even when 
established  if not entirely out of the control of a pub  
lisher  i mean  therefore  to get up a journal which 
shall be my own  at all points  with this end in view  



    death of edgar a  poe  

i must get a list of  at least  five hundred subscribers to 
begin with  nearly two hundred i have already  i 
propose  however  to go south and west  among my 
personal and literary friends old college and west 
point acquaintances and see what i can do  in order 
to get the means of taking the first step  i propose to 
lecture at the society library on thursday  the  d ot 
february and  that there may be no cause of squab  
bling  my subject shall not be literary at all  i have 
chosen a broad text  the universe   

 having thus given you the facts of the case  i leave 
all the rest to the suggestions of your own tact and 
generosity  gratefully most gratefully 

 your friend always  

  edgar a  poe   

brief and chance taken as these letters are  
we think they sufficiently prove the existence 
of the very qualities denied to mr  poe 
humility  willingness to persevere  belief in 
another s kindness  and capability of cordial 
and grateful friendship   such he assuredly 
was when sane  such only he has invariably 
seemed to us  in all we have happened person  
ally to know of him  through a friendship of 
five or six years  and so much easier is it to 
believe what we have seen and known  than 
what we hear of only  that we remember him 
but with admiration and respect these 
descriptions of him  when morally insane  
seeming to us like portraits  painted in sick  
ness  of a man we have only known in health  

but there is another  more touching  and far 
more forcible evidence that there was goodness 
in edgar a  poe  to reveal it  we are obliged 
to venture upon the lifting of the veil which 
sacredly covers grief and refinement in povert 



death of edgar a  poe      

but we think it may be excused  if so we can 
brighten the memory of the poet  even were 
there not a more needed and immediate service 
which it may render to the nearest link broken 
by his death  

our first knowledge of mr  poe s removal to 
this city was by a call which we received from 
a lady who introduced herself to us as the 
mother of his wife  she was in search of 
employment for him  and she excused her 
errand by mentioning that he was ill  that her 
daughter was a confirmed invalid  and that 
their circumstances were such as compelled 
her taking it upon herself  the countenance 
of this lady  made beautiful and saintly with 
an evidently complete giving up of her life to 
privation and sorrowful tenderness  her gentle 
and mournful voice urging its plea  her long  
forgotten but habitually and unconsciously 
refined manners  and her appealing and yet 
appreciative mention of the claims and abilities 
of her son  disclosed at once the presence of 
one of those angels upon earth that women in 
adversity can be  it was a hard fate that she 
was watching over  mr  poe wrote with fas  
tidious difficulty  and in a style too much above 
the popular level to be well paid  he was 
always in pecuniary difficulty  with his sick 
wife  frequently in want of the merest neces  
saries of life  winter after winter  for years  
the most touching sight to us  in this whole 
city  has been that tireless minister to genius  
thinly and insufficiently clad  going from office 
to office with a poem  or an article on some 



    death of edgar a  poe  

literary subject  to sell sometimes simply 
pleading in a broken voice that he was ill  and 
begging for him mentioning nothing but 
that  he was ill   whatever might be the rea  
son for his writing nothing and never  amid 
all her tears and recitals of distress  suffering 
one syllable to escape her lips that could con  
vey a doubt of him  or a complaint  or a 
lessening of pride in his genius and good inten  
tions  her daughter died  a year and a half 
since  but she did not desert him  she contin  
ued his ministering angel living with him 
caring for hkn guarding him against expos  
ure  and  when he was carried away by tempta  
tion  amid grief and the loneliness of feelings 
unreplied to  and awoke from his self abandon  
ment prostrated in destitution and suffering  
begging for him still  if woman s devotion 
born with a first love  and fed with human 
passion  hallow its object  as it is allowed to 
do  what does not a devotion like this pure  
disinterested  and holy as the watch of an 
invisible spirit say for him who inspired it  

we have a letter before us  written by this 
lady  mrs  clemm  on the morning in which she 
heard of the death of this object of her untir  
ing care  it is merely a request that we would 
call upon her  but we will copy a few of its 
words sacred as its privacy is to warrant the 
truth of the picture we have drawn above  and 
add force to the appeal we wish to make for her   



 i have this morning heard of the death of my darling 

eddie can you give me any circumstances or 

particulars          oh   do not desert your poor friend 



  death of edgar a  poe      

in this bitter affliction ask mr  to come  as 

i must deliver a message to him from my poor eddie  
     i need not ask you to notice his death and to 
ppeak well of him  i know you will  but say what an 
affectionate son he was to me  his poor desolate 
mother        

to hedge round a grave with respect  what 
choice is there  between the relinquished 
wealth and honors of the world  and the story 
of such a woman s unrewarded devotion  
risking what we do  in delicacy  by making it 
public  we feel other reasons aside that it 
betters the world to make known that there are 
such ministrations to its erring and gifted  
what we have said will speak to some hearts  
there are those who will be glad to know how 
the lamp  whose light of poverty has beamed 
on their far away recognition  was watched 
over with care and pain that they may send 
to her  who is more darkened than they by its 
extinction  some token of their sympathy  
she is destitute  and alone  if any  far or 
near  will send to us what may aid and cheer 
her through the remainder of her life  we will 
joyfully place it in her hands  



the poetic principle  



in speaking  of the poetic principle  i have 
no design to be either thorough or profound  
while discussing  very much at random  the 
essentiality of what we call poetry  my princi  
pal purpose will be to cite  for consideration  
some few of those minor english or american 
poems which best suit my own taste  or which 
upon my own fancy have left the most definite 
impressions  by  minor poems  i mean  of 
course  poems of little length  and here  in 
the beginning  permit me to say a few words 
in regard to a somewhat peculiar principle  
which  whether rightfully or wrongfully  has 
always had its influence in my own critical 
estimate of the poem  i hpld  that a  long  
poem does not exist  i maintain that the 
phrase   a long poem   is simply a flat contra  
diction in terms  

i need scarcely observe that a poem deserves 
its title only inasmuch as it excites  by elevat  
ing the soul  the value of the poem is in the 
ratio of this elevating excitement  but all 
excitements are  through a psychical necessity   
tran jpnl  that degree of excitement which 
would entitle a poem to be so called at all  can  
ot be sustained throughout a composition of   
ny great length  after the lapse of half an   

flnr fa   e a   

           



    the poetic principle  

revulsion ensues and then the poem is in 
effect  and in fast  no longer such  

there are  no doubt  many who have found 
difficulty in reconciling the critical dictum 
that the   paradise lost  is to be devoutly 
admired throughout  with the absolute impos  
sibility of maintaining for it  during perusal  
the amount of enthusiasm which that critical 
dictum would demand  this great work  in 
fact  is to be regarded as poetical only when  
losing sight of that vital requisite in all works 
of art  unity  we view it merely as a series of 
minor poems  if  to preserve its unity its 
totality of effect of impression  we read it 
 as would be necessary  at a single sitting  
the result is but a constant alternation of ex  
citement and depression  after a passage of 
what we feel to be true poetry  there follows  
inevitably  a passage of platitude which no 
critical prejudgment can force us to admire  
but if  upon completing the work  we read it 
again  omitting the first book that is to say  
commencing with the second we shall be sur  
prised at now finding that admirable which we 
before condemned that damnable which we 
had previously so much admired  it follows 
from all this that the ultimate  aggregate  or 
absolute effect of even the best epic under the 
sun is a nullity  and this is precisely jhe 
fact  

in regard to the   iliad   we have  if not 
positive proof  at least very good reason  for 
believing it intended as a series of lyrics   but  
granting the epic intention  i can say only 



the poetic principle      

that the work is based on an imperfect sense 
of art  the modern epic is  of the supposi  
titious ancient model  but an inconsiderate and 
blindfold imitation  but the day of these 
artistic anomalies is over  if  at any time  
any very long poem were popular in reality 
which i doubt it is at least clear that no very 
long poem will ever be popular again  

that the extent of a poetical work is ceteris 
paribus  the measure of its merit  seems un  
doubtedly  when we thus state it  a proposition 
sufficiently absurd yet we are indebted for 
it to the quarterly reviews  surely there 
can be nothing in mere size  abstractly consid  
ered there can be nothing in mere bulk  so 
far as a volume is concerned  which has so 
continuously elicited admiration from these 
saturnine pamphlets  a mountain  to be sure  
by the mere sentiment of physical magnitude 
which it conveys  does impress us with a sense 
of the sublime but no man is impressed after 
this fashion by the material grandeur of even 
 the columbiad   even the quarterlies 
have not instructed us to be so impressed by 
it  as yet  they have not insisted on our esti  
mating lamartine by the cubic foot  or pollock 
by the pound but what else are we to infer 
from their continual prating about  sustained 
effort   if  by  sustained effort   any little 
gentleman has accomplished an epic  let jisu 
frankly commend him fortheeffpj f nit  this 
indeed t e a thing commendable but let us 
forbear praising the epic on the effort s account  
it is to be hoped that common sense  in the 




    the poetic principle  

time to come  will prefer deciding  upon a work 
of art  rather by the impression it makes by 
the effect it produces than by the time it took 
to impress the effect  or by the amount of 
 sustained effort  which had been found nec  
essary in effecting the impression  the effort 
is  that perseverance is one thing and genius 
quite another nor can all the quarterlies in 
christendom confound them  by and by  this 
proposition  with many which i have been just 
urging  will be received as self evident  in 
the mean time  by being generally condemned 
as falsities  they will not be essentially dam  
aged as truths  

on the other hand  it is clear that a poem 
may be improperly brief  undue brevity 
degenerates into mere epigrammatism  a 
very short poem  while now and then produc  
ing a brilliant or vivid  never produces a pro  
found or enduring effect  there must be the 
steady pressing down of the stamp upon the 
wax  de beranger has wrought innumerable 
things  pungent and spirit stirring  but  in 
general  they have been too imponderous to 
stamp themselves deeply into the public atten  
tion  and thus  as so many feathers of fancy  
have been blown aloft only to be whistled 
down the wind  

a remarkable instance of the effect of undue 
brevity in depressing a poem in keeping it out 
of the popular view is afforded by the follow  
ing exquisite little serenade  

i arise from dreams of thee 
in the first sweet sleep of night  



the poetic principle      

when the winds are breathing low  
and the stars are shining bright  

i arise from dreams of thee  
and a spirit in my feet 

has led me who knows how  
to thy chamber  window  sweet f 

the wandering airs they faint 

on the dark  the silent stream 
the champak odors fall 

like sweet thoughts in a dream j 
the nightingale s complaint  

it dies upon her heart  
as i must die on thine  

o  beloved as thou art  

o  lift me from the grass  

i die  i faint  i fail   
let thy love in kisses rain 

on my lips and eyelids pale  
my cheek is cold and white  alas  

my heart beats loud and fast  
oh   press it close to thine again  

where it will break at last   

very few perhaps  are familiar with these 
lines yet no less a poet than shelley is their 
author  their warm  yet delicate and ethereal 
imagination will be appreciated by all but 
by none so thoroughly as by him who has him  
self arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved  
to bathe in the aromatic air of a southern 
midsummer night  

one of the finest poems by willis the very 
best  in my opinion  which he has ever written 
has  no doubt  through this same defect of 
undue brevity  been kept back from its proper 
position  not less in the critical than in the  
popular view  



    the poetic principle  

the shadows lay along broadway  

 twas near the twilight tide 
and slowly there a lady fair 

was walking in her pride  
alone walk d she   but  viewlessly  

walk d spirits at her side  

peace charm d the street beneath her feet  

and honor charm d the air  
and all astir looked kind on her  

and call d her good as fair 
for all god ever gave to her 

she kept with chary care  

she kept with care her bea ities rare 

from lovers warm and true 
for her heart was cold to all but gold  

and the rich came not to woo 
but honor d well are charms to sell 

if priests the selling do  

now walking there was one more fair 

a slight girl  lily pale   
and she had unseen company 

to make the spirit quail 
 twixt want and scorn she walked forlorn  

and nothing could avail  

no mercy now can clear her brow 

for this world s peace to pray  
for  as love s wild prayer dissolved in air 

her woman s heart gave way   
but the sin forgiven by christ in heaven 

by man is cursed alway  

in this composition we find it difficult to 
recognize the willis who has written so many 
mere  verses of society   the lines are not 
only richly ideal  but full of energy  while 
they breathe an earnestness an evident sin  
cerity of sentiment for which we look in vain 
throughout all the other works of this author  



the poetic principle      

while the epic mania while the idea that  
to merit in poetry  prolixity is indispensable 
has  for some years past  been gradually dying 
out of the public mind  by mere dint of its own 
absurdity we find it succeeded by a heresy 
too palpably false to be long tolerated  but one 
which  in the brief period it has already 
endured  may be said to have accomplished 
more in the corruption of our poetical litera  
ture than all its other enemies combined  i 
allude to the heresy of the didactic  it has 
been assumed  tacitly and avowedly  directly 
and indirectly  that the ultimate object of all 
poetry is truth  every poem  it is said  
should inculcate a moral   and by this moral is 
the poetical merit of the work to be adjudged  
we americans especially have patronized this 
happy idea  and we bostonians  very espe  
cially  have developed it in full  we have 
taken it into our heads that to write a poem 
simply for the poem s sake  and to acknowl  
edge such to have been our design  would be 
to confess ourselves radically wanting in the 
true poetic dignity and force   but the simple 
fact is  that  would we but permit ourselves 
to look into our own souls  we should imme  
diately there discover that under the sun there 
neither exists nor can exist any work more 
thoroughly dignified more supremely noble 
than this very poem per se this poem which 
is a poem and nothing more r this poem writ  
ten solely for the poem s saket  

with a tteep a revefence torthe true as ever 
inspired the bosom of man  i would  neverthe  



    the poetic principle  

less  limit  in some measure  its modes of incul  
cation  i would limit to enforce them  i 
would not enfeeble them by dissipation  the 
demands of truth are severe  she has no 
sympathy with the myrtles  all that which 
is so indispensable in song  is precisely all 
that with which she has nothing whatever to 
do  it is but making her a flaunting paradox  
to wreathe her in gems and flowers  in enforc  
ing a truth  we need severity rather than 
efflorescence of language  we must be simple  
precise  terse  we must be cool  calm  unim  
passioned  in a word  we must be in that 
mood which  as nearly as possible  is the exact 
converse of the poetical  he must be blind 
indeed who does not perceive the radical and 
chasmal differences between the truthful and 
the poetical modes of inculcation  he must 
be theory mad beyond redemption who  in spite 
of these differences  shall still persist in at  
tempting to reconcile the obstinate oils and 
waters of poetry and truth  

dividing the world of mind into its three 
most immediately obvious distinctions  we 
have the pure intellect  taste  and the moral 
sense  i place taste in the middle  because 
it is just this position which  in the mind  it 
occupies  it holds intimate relations with 
either extreme  but from the moral sense is 
separated by so faint a difference that aris  
totle has not hesitated to place some of its 
operations among the virtues themselves  
nevertheless  we find the offices of the trio 
marked with a sufficient distinction  just as 



the poetic principle      

the intellect concerns itself with truth  so 
taste informs us of the beautiful while the 
moral sense is regardful of duty  of this 
latter  while conscience teaches the obliga  
tion and reason the expediency  taste con  
tents herself with displaying the charms  
waging war upon vice solely on the ground of 
her deformity her disproportion her animos  
ity to the fitting  to the appropriate  to the 
harmonious in a word  to beauty  

an immortal instinct  deep within the spirit 
of man  is thus  plainly  a sense of the beauti  
ful  this it is which administers to his de  
light in the manifold forms  and sounds  and 
odors  and sentiments  amid which he exists  
and just as the lily is repeated in the lake  or 
the eyes of amaryllis in the mirror  so is 
the mere oral or written repetition of these 
forms  and sounds  and colors  and odors  and 
sentiments  a duplicate source of delight  but 
this mere repetition is not poetry  he who 
shall simply sing  with however glowing en  
thusiasm  or with however vivid a truth of 
description of the sights  and sounds  and 
odors  and colors  and sentiments  which greet 
him in common with all mankind he  i say  
has yet failed to prove his divine title  there 
is still a something in the distance which he 
has been unable to attain  we have still a 
thirst unquenchable  to allay which he has not 
shown us the crystal springs  this thirst be  
longs to the immortality of man  it is at once 
a consequence and an indication of his per  
ennial existence  it is the desire of the moth 



    the poetic principle  

for the star  it is no mere appreciation of the 
beauty before us but a wild effort to reach 
the beauty above  inspired by an ecstatic 
prescience of the glories beyond the grave  
we struggle  by multiform combinations 
among the things and thoughts of time  to 
attain a portion of that loveliness whose very 
elements  perhaps  appertain to eternity alone  
and thus when by poetry or when by music  
the most entrancing of the poetic moods we 
find ourselves melted into tears we weep 
then not as the abbate gravina supposes 
through excess of pleasure  but through a cer  
tain petulant  impatient sorrow at our inability 
to grasp now wholly  here on earth  at once 
and forever  those divine and rapturous joys  
of which through the poem  or through the 
music  we attain to but brief and indetermi  
nate glimpses  

the struggle to apprehend the supernal 
loveliness this struggle  on the part of souls 
fittingly constituted has given to the world 
all that which it  the world  has ever been 
enabled at once to understand and to feel as 
poetic  

the poetic sentiment  of course  may de  
velop itself in various modes in painting  in 
sculpture  in architecture  in the dance 
very especially in music and very peculiarly  
and with a wide field  in the composition of 
the landscape garden  our present theme  
however  has regard only to its manifestation 
in words  and here let me speak briefly on 
the topic of rhythm  contenting myself with 



the poetic principle      

the certainty that music  in its various modes 
of meter  rhythm  and rhyme  is of so vast a 
moment in poetry as never to be wisely re  
jected is so vitally important and adjunct  
that he is simply silly who declines its assist  
ance  i will not now pause to maintain its 
absolute essentiality  it is in music  perhaps  
that the soul most nearly attains the great end 
for which  when inspired by the poetic senti  
ment  it struggles the creation of supernal 
beauty  it may be  indeed  that here this 
sublime end is  now and then  attained in fact  
we are often made to feel  with a shivering 
delight  that from an earthly harp  are stricken 
notes which cannot have been unfamiliar to 
the angels  and thus there can be little doubt 
that in the union of poetry with music in its 
popular sense  we shall find the widest field 
for the poetic development  the old bards 
and minnesingers had advantages which we 
do not possess and thomas moore  singing 
his own songs  was  in the most legitimate 
manner  perfecting them as poems  

to recapitulate  then   i would define  in 
brief  the poetry of words as the rhythmical 
creation ot beauty  its sole arbiter is taste  
witltthe intellect or w nr f trconscience   t 
has only collateral relations  unless incident  
ally  it has no concern whatever either with 
duty or with truth  

a few words  however  in explanation  
that pleasure which is at once the most pure  
the most elevating  and the most intense  is 
derived  i maintain  from the contemplation 



    the poetic principle  

of the beauffiul  in the contemplation of 
beauty we alone find it possible to attain that 
pleasurable elevation  or excitement  of the 
soul  which we recognize as the poetic senti  
ment  and which is so easily distinguished 
from truth  which is the satisfaction of the rea  
son  or from passion  which is the excitement 
of the heart  i make beauty  therefore using 
the word as inclusive of the sublime i ma 



beauty the province of the poem  simply   
cause it is an obvious rule of art that effects 
should be made to spring as directly as pos  
sible from their causes no one as yet having 
been weak enough to deny that the peculiar 
elevation in question is at least most readily 
attainable in the poem  it by no means fol  
lows  however  that the incitements of passion  
or the precepts of duty  or even the lessons of 
truth  may not be introduced into a poem  
and with advantage   for they may subserve  
incidentally  in various ways  the general pur  
poses of the work  but the true artist will 
always contrive to tone them down in proper 
subjection to that beauty which is the atmos  
phere and the real essence of the poem  

i cannot better introduce the few poems 
which i shall present for your consideration  
than by the citation of the proem to mr  
longfellow s  waif   

the day is done  and the darkness 

falls from the wings of night  
as a feather is wafted downward 

from an eagle in his flight 



the poetic principle      

i see the lights of the village 
gleam through the rain and the mist  

and a feeling of sadness comes o er me 
that my soul cannot resist   

a feeling of sadness and longing  

that is not akin to pain  
and resembles sorrow only 

as the mist resembles the rain  

come  read to me some poem  

some simple and heartfelt lay  
that shall soothe this restless feeling 

and banish the thoughts of day  

not from the grand old masters  

not from the bards sublime  
 whose distant footsteps echo 

through the corridors of time  

for  like strains of martial music  

their mighty thoughts suggest 
life s endless toil and endeavor  

and to night i long for rest  

read from some humbler poet  
whose songs gushed from his heart  

as showers from the clouds of summer  
or tears from the eyelids start   

who through long days of labor  

and nights devoid of ease  
still heard in his soul the music 

of wonderful melodies  

such songs have power to quiet 

the restless pulse of care  
and come like the benediction 

that follows after prayer  

then read from the treasured volume 

the poem of thy choice  
and lend to the rhyme of the poet 

the beauty of thy voice  
   foe s poemsj 



    the poetic principle  

and the night shall be filled with music  
and the cares  that infest the day  

shall fold their tents  like the arabs  
and as silently steal away  

with no great range of imagination  these 
lines have been admired for their delicacy of 
expression  some of the images are very 
effective  nothing can be better than 



 the bards sublime  



whose distant footsteps echo 
through the corridors of time  

the idea of the last quotation is also very 
effective  the poem  on the whole  however  
is chiefly to be admired for th  graceful in  
souciance of its meter  so well in accordance 
with the character of the sentiments  and espe  
cially for the ease of the general manner  
this  ease   or naturalness  in a literary 
style  it has long been the fashion to regard as 
ease in appearance alone as a point of really 
difficult attainment  but not so  a natural 
manner is difficult only to him who should 
never meddle with it to the unnatural  it is 
but the result of writing with the understand  
ing  or with the instinct  that the tone  in 
composition  should always be that which the 
mass of mankind would adopt and must per  
petually vary  of course  w th the occasion  
the author  who  after the fashion of the 
north american review  should be  upon all 
occasions  merely  quiet   must necessarily 
upon many occasions be simply silly  or stupid   
and has no more right to be considered 
 easy   or  natural  than a cockney ex  



the poetic principle      

quisite  or than the sleeping beauty in the 
wax works  

among the minor poems of bryant  none 
has so much impressed me as the one which he 
entitles  june   i quote only a portion of it  

there  through the long  long summer hours  

the golden light should lie  
and thick  young herbs and groups of flowers 

stand in their beauty by  
the oriole should build and tell 
his lovetale  close beside my cell   

the idle butterfly 

should rest him there  and there be heard 
the housewife bee and humming bird  

and what  if cheerful shouts  at noon  

come  from the village sent  
or songs of maids  beneath the moon  

with fairy laughter bent  
and what if  in the evening light  
betrothed lovers walk in sight 

of my low monument  
i would the lovely scene around 
might know no sadder sight nor sound  

i know  i know i should not see 

the season s glorious show  
nor would its brightness shine for me  

nor its wild musi flow   
but if  around my pi ce of sleep  
the friends i love should come to weep  

they might not haste to go  
soft airs  and song  and light  and bloom 
should keep them lingering by my tomb  

these to their softened hearts should bear 

the thought of what has been  
and speak of one who cannot share 

the gladness of the scene   
whose part in all the pomp that fills 



    the poetic principle  

the circuit of the summer hills  
is that his grave is green   
and deeply would their hearts rejoice 
to hear again his living voice  

the rhythmical flow  here  is even voluptu  
ous nothing could be more melodious  the 
poem has always affected me in a remarkable 
manner  the intense melancholy which seems 
to well up  perforce  to the surface of all the 
poet s cheerful sayings about his grave  we 
find thrilling us to the soul while there is the 
truest poetic elevation in the thrill  the im  
pression left is one of a pleasurable sadness  
and if  in the remaining compositions which i 
shall introduce to you  there be more or less of 
a similar tone always apparent  let me remind 
you that  how or why we know not  this cer  
tain taint of sadness is inseparably connected 
with all the higher manifestations of true 
beauty  it is  nevertheless  

a feeling of sadness and longing 

that is not akin to pain  
and resembles sorrow only 

as the mist resembles the rain  

the taint of which i speak is clearly per  
ceptible even in a poem so full of brilliancy 
and spirit as the  health  of edward coat 
pinkuey   

i fill this cup to one made up 

of loveliness alone  
a woman  of her gentle sex 

the seeming paragon   
to whom the better elements 



the poetic principle      

and kindly stars have given 
a form so fair  that  like the air  
 tis less of earth than heaven  

her every tone is music s own 

like those of morning birds  
and something more than melody 

dwells ever in her words   
the coinage of her heart are they  

and from her lips each flows 
as one may see the burden d bee 

forth issue from the rose  

affections are as thoughts to her  

the measures of her hours   
her feelings have the fragrancy  

the freshness of young flowers   
and lovely passions  changing oft  

so fill her  she appears 
the image of themselves by turns   

the idol of past years   

of her bright face one glance will trace 

a picture on the brain  
and of her voice in echoing hearts 

a sound must long remain   
but memory  such as mine of her  

so very much endears  
when death is nigh  my latest sigh 

will not be life s  but hers  

i fill d this cup to one made up 

of loveliness alone  
a woman  of her gentle sex 

the seeming paragon 
her health   and would on earth there stood 

some more of such a frame  
that life might be all poetry  

and weariness a name  

it was the misfortune of mr  pinkney to 
have been born too far south  had he been a 
new englander  it is probable that he would 



    the poetic principle  

have been ranked as the first of american lyr  
ists  by that magnanimous cable which has so 
long controlled the destinies of american let  
ters  in conducting the thing called the north 
american review  the poem just cited is 
especially beautiful   but the poetic elevation 
which it induces  we must refer chiefly to our 
sympathy in the poet s enthusiasm  we par  
don his hyperboles for the evident earnestness 
with which they are uttered  

it was by no means my design  however  to 
expatiate upon the merits of what i should 
read you  these will necessarily speak for 
themselves  boccalini  in his   advertise  
ments from parnassus   tells us that zoilus 
once presented apollo a very caustic criticism 
upon a very admirable book  whereupon the 
god asked him for the beauties of the work  
he replied that he only busied himself about 
the errors  on hearing this  apollo  handing 
him a sack of unwinnowed wheat  bade him to 
pick out all the chaff for his reward  

now this fable answers very well as a hit at 
the critics but i am by no means sure that 
the god was in the right  i am by no means 
certain that the true limits of the critical duty 
are not grossly misunderstood  excellence  
in a poem especially  may be considered in the 
light of an axiom  which need only be properly 
put  to become self evident  it is not excel  
lence if it require to be demonstrated as such   
and thus  to point out too particularly the 
merits of a work of art  is to admit that they 
are not merits altogether  



the poetic principle      

among the  melodies  of thomas moore  
is one whose distinguished character as a poem 
proper  seems to have been singularly left out 
of view  i allude to his lines beginning 
   come  rest in this bosom   the intense 
energy of their expression is not surpassed by 
anything in byron  there are two of the 
lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that 
embodies the all in all of the divine passion of 
love a sentiment which  perhaps has found 
its echo in more  and in more passionate  
human hearts than any other single sentiment 
ever embodied in words   

come  rest in this bosom  my own stricken deer  
though the herd have fled from thee  thy home is still 

here  

here still is the smile  that no cloud can o ercast  
and a heart and a hand all thy own to the last  

oh   what was love made for  if  t is not the same 
through joy and through torment  through glory and 

shame  

i know not  i ask not  if guilt s in that heart  
i but know that i love thee  whatever thou art 

thou hast call d me thy angel in moments of bliss  
and thy angel i ll be   mid the horrors of this  
through the furnace  unshrinking  thy steps to pursue  
and shield thee  and save thee  or perish there  too  

it has been the fashion  of late days  to deny 
moore imagination  while granting him fancy 
a distinction originating with coleridge 
than whom no man more fully comprehended 
the great powers of moore  the fact is  that 
the fancy of this poet so far predominates 
over all his other faculties  and over the fancy 



    the poetic principle  

of all other men  as to have induced  very 
naturally  the idea that he is a fanciful only  
but never was there a greater mistake  
never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a 
true poet  in the compass of the english lan  
guage   can call to mind no poem more pro  
foundly more weirdly imaginative in the best 
sense  than the lines commencing   i would 
i were by that dim lake  which are the com  
position of thomas moore  i regret that i am 
unable to remember them  

one of the noblest and  speaking of fancy  
one of the most singularly fanciful of modern 
poets  was thomas hood  his  fair ines  
had always  for me  an inexpressible charm   

o saw ye not fair ines  

she s gone into the west  
to dazzle when the sun is down 

and rob the world of rest   
she took our daylight with her  

the smiles that we love best  
with morning blushes on her cheek  

and pearls upon her breast  

o turn again  fair ines  

before the fall of night  
for fear the moon should shine alone  

and the stars unrival d bright   
and blessed will the lover be 

that walks beneath their light  
and breathes the love against thy cheek 

i dare not even write   

would i had been  fair ines  

that gallant cavalier  j 

who rode so gayly by thy side  

and whisper d thee so near   
were there no bonny dames at home  



the poetic principle      

or no true lovers here  
that he should cross the seas to win 
the dearest of the dear  

i saw thee  lovely ines  

descend along the shore  
with bands of noble gentlemen  

and banners wav d before   
and gentle youth and maidens gay  

and snowy plumes they wore   
it would have been a beauteous dream  

if it had been no more   

alas  alas  fair ines  

she went away with song  
with music waiting on her steps  

and shoutings of the throng   
but some were sad and felt no mirth  

but only music s wrong  
in sounds that sang farewell  farewell  

to her you ve loved so long  

farewell  farewell  fair ines  

that vessel never bore 
so fair a lady on its deck  

nor danced so light before  
alas for pleasure on the sea  

and sorrow on the shore   
the smile that blessed one lover s heart 

has broken many more  

 the haunted house   by the same author  
is one of the truest poems ever written one 
of the truest one of the most unexception  
able one of the most thoroughly artistic  both 
in its theme and in its execution  it is  more  
over  powerfully ideal imaginative  i regret 
that its length renders it unsuitable for the pur  
poses of this lecture  in place of it  permit 
me to offer the universally appreciated 
 bridge of sighs

young  and so fair  

look at her garments 
clinging like cerements

touch her not scornfully  
think of her mournfully  
gently and humanly  
not of the stains of her  
all that remains of her

past all dishonor  
death has left on her

who was her mother  

had she a sister  

had she a brother  

or was there a dearer one 

still  and a nearer one 

yet  than all other  

alas  for the rarity 
of christian charity 
under the sun  
oh  it was pitiful  
near a whole city full  
home she had none  

sisterly  brotherly  
fatherly  motherly 
feelings had changed  
love  by harsh evidence 
thrown from its eminence  
even god s providence 
seeming estranged  

where the lamps quiver 
so far in the river  
with many a light 
from window and case  
ment  

from garret to basement  
she stood  with amazement 
houseless by night    

the bleak wind of march 
made her tremble and 

shiver 

but not the black arch

mad from life s history  
glad to death s mystery  
swift to be hurl d

last look of despairing 
fixed on futurity

spurred by contumely  
cold inhumanity

stiffen so rigidly  
decently  kindly  
smooth and compose them  
and her eyes  close them  
staring so blindly  

the vigor of this poem is no less remarkable 
than its pathos  the versification  although 
carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the 
fantastic  is nevertheless admirably adapted to 
the wild insanity which is the thesis of the 
poem  

among the minor poems of lord byron  is 
one which has never received from the critics 
the praise which it undoubtedly deserves   

though the day of my destiny s over  

and the star of my fate hath declined  
thy soft heart refused to discover 

the faults which so many could find  
though thy soul with my grief was acquainted 

it shrunk not to share it with me  
and the love which my spirit hath painted 

it never hath found but in thee  



    the poetic principle  

then when nature around me is smiling  

the last smile which answers to mine  
i do not believe it beguiling  

because it reminds me of thine   
and when winds are at war with the ocean  

as the breasts i believed in with me  
if their billows excite an emotion  

it is that they bear me from thee  

though the rock of my last hope is snivered  

and its fragments are sunk in the wave  
though i feel that my soul is delivered 

to pain it shall not be its slave  
there is many a pang to pursue me   

they may crush  but they shall not contemn 
they may torture  but shall not subdue me 

 tis of thee that i think not of them  

though human  thou didst not deceive me  

though woman  thou didst not forsake  
though loved  thou forborest to grieve me  

though slandered  thou never couldst shake  
though trusted  thou didst not disclaim me  

though parted  it was not to fly  
though watchful   t was not to defame me  

nor mute  that the world might belie  

yet i blame not the world  nor despise it  

nor the war of the many with one 
if my soul was not fitted to prize it  

 t was folly not sooner to shun  
and if dearly that error hath cost me  

and more than i once could foresee  
i have found that whatever it lost me  

it could not deprive me of thee  

from the wreck of the past  which hath perished  

thus much i at least may recall  
it hath taught me that which i most cherished 

deserved to be dearest of all   
in the desert a fountain is springing  

in the wide waste there still is a tree  



and a bird in the solitude singing  
 h speaks to my spirit of thee 



which j 



the poetic principle      

although the rhythm  here  is one of the most 
difficult  the versification could scarcely be 
improved  no nobler theme ever engaged the 
pen of poet  it is the soul elevating idea  that 
no man can consider t himself entitled to

sincerity i regard him as the noblest poet that 
ever lived i have left myself time to cite only 
a very brief specimen  i call him  and think 
him the noblest of poets not because the 
impressions he produces are  at all times  the 
most profound not because the poetical 
excitement which he induces  is at all times  
the most intense but because it is  at all 
times  the most ethereal in other words  the 
most elevating and the most pure  no poet is 
so little of the earth  earthy  what i am 
about to read is from his last long poem    the 
princess   

tears  idle tears  i know not what they mean  
tears from the depth of some divine despair  
rise in the heart  and gather to the eyes  
in looking on the happy autumn fields  
and thinking of the days that are no more  

fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail  
that brings our friends up from the underworld  
sad as the last which reddens over one 
that sinks with all we love below the verge  
so sad  so fresh  the days that are no more  

ah  sad and strange as in dark summer dawns 
the earliest pipe of half awaken d birds 
to dying ears  when unto dying eyes 
the casement slowly grows a glimmering square  
so sad  so strange  the days that are no more  



    the poetic principle  

dear as remember d kisses after death  
and sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign  d 
on lips that are for others   deep as love  
deep as first love  and wild with all regret   
o death in life  the days that are no more  

thus  although in a very cursory and imper  
fect manner  i have endeavored to convey to 
you my conception of the poetic principle  it 
has been my purpose to suggest that  while 
this principle itself is  strictly and simply  the 
human aspiration  far ftnpe rnfl   ifeaqtyi the 
manifestation of the principle is alyaya found 
in an elevating excitement of then oull q ui te 
independent of that passion which is the intox  
ication of the heart or of that truth which 
is the satisfaction of the reason  for  in 
regard to passion  alas  its tendency is to 
degrade  rather than to elevate the soul  
love  on the contrary love the true  the 
divine eros the uranian  as distinguished 
from the dionaean venus is unquestionably 
the purest and truest of all poetical themes  
still in regard to truth if  to be sure  
through the attainment of a truth  we are led 
to perceive a harmony where none was appar  
ent before  we experience  at once  the true 
poetical effect but this effect is referable to 
the harmony alone  and not in the least degree 
to the truth which merely served to render the 
harmony manifest  

we shall reach  however  more immediately 
a distinct conception of what the true poetry 
is  by mere reference to a few of the simple 
elements which induce in the poet himself the 



the poetic principle      

true poetical effect  he recognizes the 
ambrosia which nourishes his soul  in the bright 
orbs that shine in heaven in the volutes of 
the flower in the clustering of low shrubberies 
in the waving of the grain fields in the 
slanting of tall  eastern trees in the blue dis  
tance of mountains in the grouping of clouds 
in the twinkling of half hidden brooks in 
the gleaming of silver rivers in the repose of 
sequestered lakes in the star mirroring depths 
of lonely wells  he perceives it in the songs 
of birds in the harp of   eolus in the sighing 
of the night wind in the repining voice of 
the forest in the surf that complains to the 
shore in the fresh breath of the woods in 
the scent of the violet in the voluptuous per  
fume of the hyacinth in the suggestive odor 
that comes to him at eventide  from far dis  
tant  undiscovered islands  over dim oceans  
illimitable and unexplored  he owns it in all 
noble thoughts in all unworldly motives in 
all holy impulses in all chivalrous  generous  
and self sacrificing deeds  he feels it in the 
beauty of woman in the grace of her step in 
the luster of her eye in the melody of her 
voice in her soft laughter in her sigh in 
the harmony of the rustling of her robes  he 
deeply feels it in her winning endearments 
in her burning enthusiasms in her gentle 
charities in her meek and devotional endur  
ances but above all ah  far above all he 
kneels to it he worships it in the faith  in the 
purity  in the strength  in the altogether 
divine majesty of her love  



    the poetic principle  

let me   conclude by the recitation of yet 
another brief poem one very different in 
character from any | iat i have before quoted  
it is by motherwell  and is called  the song 
of the cavalier   with our modern and alto  
gether rational ideas of the absurdity and impi  
ety of warfare  we are not precisely in that 
frame of mind best adapted to sympathize with 
the sentiments  and thus to appreciate the real 
excellence of the poem  to do this fully  we 
must identify ourselves  in fancy  with the soul 
of the old cavalier  

then mounte   then mounte   brave gallants  all  

and don your helmes amaine  
deathe s couriers  fame and honor  call 

us to the field againe  
no shrewish teares shall fill our eye 

when the sword hilt s in our hand  
heart whole we ll part  and no whit sighe 

for the f ayrest of the land   
let piping swaine  and craven wight  

thus weepe and puling crye  
our business is like men to fight  

and hero like to die

preface to the poems  

these trifles are collected and republished chiefly with 
a view to their redemption from the many improve  
ments to which they have been subjected while going 
at random  the rounds of the press    i am naturally 
anxious that what i have written should circulate as i 
wrote it  if it circulate at all  in defense of my own 
taste  nevertheless  it is incumbent upon me to say that 
i think nothing in this volume of much value to the   
public  or very creditable to myself  events not to be 
controlled have prevented me from making  at any time  
any serious effort in what  under happier circum  
stances  would have been the field of my choice  with 
me poetry has been not a purpose  but a passion   and 
the passions should be held in reverence   they must not 
they cannot at will be excited  with an eye to the 
paltry compensations  or the more paltry commenda  
tions  of mankind  e  a  p  



  



poems  



the raven  

once upon a midnight dreary  while i pon  
dered weak and weary  

over many a quaint and curious volume of 
forgotten lore 

while i nodded  nearly napping  suddenly 
there came a tapping 

as of some one gently rapping  rapping at 
my cham ber door  

   tis some visitor   i muttered     tapping at 
my chamber door 

only this and nothing more    

ah  distinctly i remember it was in the bleak 

december  
and each separate dying ember wrought its 

ghost upon the floor  
eagerly i wished the morrow   vainly i had 

sought to borrow 
from my books surcease of sorrow sorrow for 

the lost lenore 
for the rare and radiant maiden whom the 

angels name lenore 

nameless here for evermore  

and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each 

purple curtain 
thrilled me filled me with fantastic terrors 

never felt before   

    



    poe s poems  

so that now  to still the beating of my heart  i 

stood repeating 
    tis some visitor entreating entrance at my 

chamber door 
some late visitor entreating entrance at my 

chamber door  

this it is and nothing more   

presently my soul grew stronger  hesitating 
then no longer  

   sir   said i   or  madam  truly your for  
giveness i implore   

but the fact is i was napping  and so gently 
you came rapping  

and so faintly you came tapping  tapping at 
my chamber door  

that i scarce was sure i heard you   here i 

opened wide the door 

darkness there and nothing more  

deep into that darkness peering  long i stood 
there wondering  fearing  

doubting  dreaming dreams no mortals ever 
dared to dream before  

but the silence was unbroken  and the stillness 
gave no token  

and the only word there spoken was the whis  
pered word   lenore   

this i whispered  and an echo murmured back 
the word   lenore   

merely this and nothing more  

back into the chamber turning  all my soul 
within me burning  



foe s poems  k  

soon again i heard a tapping something louder 
than before  

  surely   said i    surely that is something at 
my window lattice   

let me see  then  what thereat is and this 
mystery explore 

let my heart be still a moment and this mys  
tery explore   

 tis the wind and nothing more    

open here i flung the shutter  when  with 

many a flirt and flutter 
in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly 

days of yore  
not the least obeisance made he   not a minute 

stopped or stayed he  
but  with mien of lord or lady  perched above 

my chamber door 
perched upon a bust of pallas just above my 

chamber door 

perched  and sat and nothing more  

then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy 
into smiling  

by the grave and stern decorum of the counte  
nance it wore  

  though thy crest be shorn and shaven  thou    
i said   art sure no craven  

ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering 
from the nightly shore 

n ell me what thy lordly name is on the 
night s plutonian shore   

quoth the raven  nevermore   



    poe s poems  

much i marveled this ungainly fowl to hear 

discourse so plainly  
though its answer little meaning little 

relevancy bore  
for we cannot help agreeing that no living 

human being 
ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above 

his chamber door 
bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above 

his chamber door  

with such name as  nevermore   

but the raven  sitting lonely on that placid 

bust  spoke only 
that one word  as if his soul in that one word 

he did outpour  
nothing farther then he uttered   not a feather 

then he fluttered 
till i scarcely more than muttered  other 

friends have flown before 
on the morrow he will leave me  as my hopes 

have flown before      

then the bird said  nevermore   

startled at the stillness broken by reply so 
aptly spoken  

 doubtless   said i   what it utters is its only 
stock and store 

caught from some unhappy master whom un  
merciful disaster 

followed fast and followed faster till his songs 
one burden bore 

till the dirges of his hope that melancholy 
burden bore 

of   never nevermore   tf 



poe s poems      

but the raven still beguiling all my sad soul 
into smiling  

straight   wheeled a cushioned seat in front of 
bird and bust and door  

then  upon the velvet sinking  i  betook my  
self to linking 

fancy unto fancy  thinking what this ominous 
bird of yore 

what this grim  ungainly  ghastly  gaunt  and 
ominous bird of yore 

meant in croaking  nevermore   

thus i sat engaged in guessing  but no syllable 
expressing 

to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into 
my bosom s core  

this and more i sat divining  with my head at 
ease reclining 

on the cushion s velvet lining that the lamp  
light gloated o er  

but whose velvet violet lining with the lamp  
light gloating o er 

she shall press  ah  nevermore  

then  methought  the air grew denser  per  
fumed from an unseen censer 

swung by seraphim whose foot falls tinkled 
on the tufted floor  

 wretch   i cried   thy god hath lent thee 
by these angels he hath sent thee 

respite respite and nepenthe from thy mem  
ories of lenore   

quaff  oh  quaff this kind nepenthe and forget 
this lost lenore   

quoth the raven   nevermore

still  if bird or devil  
whether tempest sent  or whether tempest 

tossed thee here ashore

enchanted 
on this home by horror haunted tell me 

truly  i implore 
is there is there balm in gilead  tell me 

tell me  i implore   

quoth the raven   nevermore   

 prophet   said i   thing of evil prophet 

still  if bird or devil  
by that heaven that bends above us by that 

god we both adore 
tell this soul with sorrow laden if  within the 

distant aidenn  
it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels 

name lenore 
clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the 

angels name lenore   

quoth the raven   nevermore   

 be that word our sign of parting  bird or 

fiend   i shrieked  upstarting 
 get thee back into the tempest and the 

night s plutonian shore  
leave no black plume as a token of that lie 

thy soul hath spoken   
leave my loneliness unbroken  quit the bust

thy form from off my door

and the raven  never flitting  still is sitting  

still is sitting 
on the pallid bust of pallas just above my 

chamber door   
and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon s 

that is dreaming  
and the lamp light o er him streaming throws 

his shadow on the floor  
and my soul from out that shadow that lies 

floating on the floor  

shall be lifted nevermore

i saw thee once once only years ago  

i must not say how many but not many  

it was a july midnight  and from out 

a full orbed moon  that  like thine own soul  

soaring  
sought a precip itate pathway up through 

heaven  

there fell a silvery silken veil of light  
with quietude  and sultriness  and slumber  
upon the upturn  d faces of a thousand 
roses that grew in an enchanted garden  
where no winds dared to stir  unless on tip  
toe 

fell on the upturn d faces of these roses 
that gave out  in return for the love light  
their odorous souls in an ecstatic death 
fell on the upturn d faces of these roses 
that smiled and died in this parterre  en  
chanted 

by thee  and by the poetry of thy presence  
clad all in white  upon a violet bank 



poe s poems      

i saw thee half reclining  while the moon 
fell on the upturn d faces of the roses  
and on thine own  upturn d alas  in sorrow  
was it not fate  that  on this july midnight 
was it not fate   whose name is also sorrow   
that bade me pause before that garden gate  
to breathe the incense of those slumbering 

roses  

no footsteps stirred   the hated world all slept  
save only thee and me   oh  heaven   oh  

god  
how my heart beats in coupling those two 

words    

save only thee and me  i paused i looked 
  and in an instant all things disappeared  
 ah  bear in mind this garden was enchanted   
the pearly luster of the moon went out  
the mossy banks and the meandering paths  
the happy flowers and the repining trees  
were seen no more   the very roses  odors 
died in the arms of the adoring airs  
all all expired save thee save less than thou  
save only the divine light in thine eyes 
save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes  
i saw but them   they were the world to me  
i saw but them saw only them for hours 
saw only them until the moon went down  
what wild heart histories seemed to lie en  
written 

upon those crystalline  pelestial spheres  
how dark a woe   yet how sublime a hope   
how silently serene a sea of pride   
how daring an ambition   yet how deep 
how fathomless a capacity for love  



    foe s poems  

but now  at length  dear dian sank from 

sight  

into a western couch of thunder cloud  
and thou  a ghost  amid the entombing trees 
didst glide away  only thine eyes remained  
they would not go they never yet have gone  
lighting my lonely pathway home that night  
they have not left me  as my hopes have  

since 
they follow me they lead me through the 

years 

they are my ministers yet i their slave  
their office is to illumine and enkindle 
my duty  to be saved by their bright light  
and purified in their electric fire  
and sanctified in their elysian fire  
they fill my soul with beauty  which is hope   
and aire far up in heaven the stars i kneel to 
in the sad  silent watches of my night   
while even in the meridian glare of day 
i see them still two sweetly scintillant 
venuses  unextinguished by the sun   

to   

not long ago  the writer of these lines  
in the mad pride of intellectuality  
maintained  the power of words  denied 

that ever 

a thought arose within the human brain 
beyond the utterance of the human tongue  
and now  as if in mockery of that boast  
two words two foreign soft dissyllables 
italian tones  made only to be murmured 



poe s poems      

by angels dreaming in the moonlit  dew 
that hangs like chains of pearl on hermon 

hill   

have stirred from out the abysses of his heart  
unthought like thoughts that are the souls of 

thought  

richer  far wilder  far diviner visions 
than even the seraph harper  israfel  
 who has  the sweetest voice of all god s 

creatures    
could hope to utter  and i   my spells are 

broken  
the pen falls powerless from my shivering 

hand  
with thy dear name as text  though bidden by 

thee  

i cannot write i cannot speak or think 
alas  i cannot feel  for  tis not feeling  
this standing motionless upon the golden 
threshold of the wide open gate of dreams  
gazing entranced  adown the gorgeous vista  
and thrilling as i see  upon the right  
upon the left  and all the way along  
amid unpurpled vapors  far away 
to where the prospect terminates thee only  

ulalume  

the skies they were ashen and sober  

the leaves they were crisped and sere 
the leaves they were withering and sere  
it was light in the lonesome october 

of my most immemorial year  
it was hard by the dim lake of auber  
   fotfs poemp  



    foe s poems  

in the misty mid region of weir 
it was down by the dank tarn of auber 

in the ghoul haunted woodland of weir  
here once  through an alley titanic  

of cypress  i roamed with my soul 

of cypress  with psyche  my soul  
these were days when my heart was volcanic 

as the scoriae rivers that roll 

as the lavas that restlessly roll 
their sulphurous currents down mount yaanek 

in the ultimate climes of the pole 
that groan as they roll down mount yaanek 

in the realms of the boreal pole  

our talk had been serious and sober  

but our thoughts they were palsied and 

sere 
our memories were treacherous and sere 

for we knew not the month was october  

and we marked not the night of the year   
 ah  night of all nights in the year    

we noted not the dim lake of auber 

 though once we had journeyed down 
here  

remembered not the dank tarn of auber  

nor the ghoul haunted woodland of weir  

and now  as the night was senescent 
and star dials pointed to morn 
as the star dials hinted of morn 

at the end of our path a liquescent 
and nebulous luster was born  

out of which a miraculous crescent 
arose with a duplicate horn 



poe s poems      

astarte s bediamonded crescent 
distinct with its duplicate horn  

and i said  she is warmer than dian  
she rolls through an ether of sighs 
she revels in a region of sighs   

she has seen that the tears are not dry on 

these cheeks  where the worm never dies  

and has come past the stars of the lion 
to point us the path to the skies 
to the lethean peace of the skies 

come up  in despite of the lion  

to shine on us with her bright eyes 

come up through the lair of the lion  
with love in her luminous eyes   

but psyche  uplifting her finger  

said  sadly this star i mistrust 
her pallor i strangely mistrust   

oh  hasten  oh  let us not linger  

oh  fly  let us fly  for we must   

in terror she spoke  letting sink her 

wings until they trailed in the dust 

in agony sobbed letting sink her 

plumes till they trailed in the dust 
till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust  

i replied  this is nothing but dreaming  
let us on by this tremulous light  
let us bathe in this crystalline light   

its sybilic splendor is beaming 

with hope and in beauty to night  
see   it flickers up the sky through the 
night   

ah  we safely may trust to its gleaming 



    poe s poems  

and be sure it will lead us aright 
we safely may trust to a gleaming 
that cannot but guide us aright  
since it flickers up to heaven through the 
night    

thus i pacified psyche and kissed her  
and tempted her out of her gloom 
and conquered her scruples and gloom   

and we passed to the end of the vista  

but were stopped by the door of a tomb 
by the door of a legended tomb   

and i said  what is written  sweet sister 
on the door of this legended tomb   
she replied  ulalume ulalume 
 tis the vault of thy lost ulalume   

then my heart it grew ashen and sober 

as the leaves that were crisped and sere 
as the leaves that were withering and sere  

and i cried  it was surely october 
on this very night of last year 
that i journeyed i journeyed down 

here 
that i brought a dread burden down 

here 

on this night of all nights in the year  
ah  what demon has tempted me here  

well i know  now  this dim lake of auber 
this misty mid region of weir  

well i know  now  this dank tarn of auber  
this ghoul haunted woodland of weir

how they tinkle  tinkle  tinkle  

in the icy air of night  
while the stars that oversprinkle 
all the heavens seem to twinkle 
with the crystalline delight  
keeping time  time  time  
in a sort of runic rhyme  

to the tintinnabulation that so musically wells 
from the bells  bells  bells  bells

from the jingling and the tinkling of the bells

what a world of happiness their harmony fore  
tells  

through the balmy air of night 
how they ring out their delight  
from the molten golden notes  

and all in tune  
what a liquid ditty floats 
to the turtle dove that listens  while 

she gloats 
on the moon  
oh  trom out the sounding cells  



    poe s poems  

what a gush of euphony voluminously wells

brazen bells  
what a tale of terror  now  their turbulency 

tells  

in the startled ear of night 
how they scream out their affright  
too much horrified to speak  
they can only shriek  shriek  

out of tune  
in a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the 

fire  

in a mad expostulation with the deaf and 
frantic fire 

leaping higher  higher  higher  
with a desperate desire  
and a resolute endeavor 
now now to sit or never  
by the side of the pale faced moon  
oh  the bells  bells  bells  
what a tale their terror tells 

of despair  
how they clang  and clash  and roar  



poe s poems      

what a horror they outpour 
on the bosom of the palpitating air  
yet the ear it fully knows  
by the twanging  
and the clanging  
how the danger ebbs and flows  
yet the ear distinctly tells  
in the jangling  
and the wrangling  
how the danger sinks and swells  
by the sinking or the swelling in the anger of 
the bells 
of the bells 
of the bells  bells  bells  bells

in the clamor and the clangor of the bells  



hear the tolling of the bells 

iron bells  
what a world of solemn thought their monody 

compels   

in the silence of the night  
how we shiver with affright  
at the melancholy menace of their tone  
for every sound that floats 
from the rust within their throats 

is a groan  

and the people ah  the people 
they that dwell up in the steeple  

all alone  
and who tolling  tolling  tolling  

in that muffled monotone  
feel a glory in so rolling

they are neither man nor woman 
they are neither brute nor human 

they are ghouls

and he rolls  rolls  rolls  

rolls 

a paean from the bells  
and his merry bosom swells 
with the paean of the bells  
and he dances  and he yells  
keeping time  time  time  
in a sort of runic rhyme  
to the paean of the bells 

of the bells  

keeping time  time  time 
in a sort of runic rhyme  

to the throbbing of the bells

to my mother  

because i feel that in the heavens above  

the angels  whispering to one another  
can find  among their burning terms of love  

none so devotional as that of  mother   
therefore by that dear name i long have 
called you 

you who are more than mother unto me  
and fill my heart of hearts  where death in  
stalled you  

in setting my virginia s spirit free

was but the mother of myself  but you

the haunted palace  

in the greenest of our valleys 

by good angels tenanted  
once a fair and stately palace 

radiant palace reared its head  
in the monarch thought s dominion 

it stood there  
never seraph spread a pinion    

over fabric half so fair  

banners yellow  glorious  golden  

on its roof did float and flow  
 this all this was in the olden 

time long ago   



    poe s poems  

and eveiy gentle air that dallied  

in that sweet day  
along the ramparts plumed and pallid  

a winged odor went away  

wanderers in that happy valley  

through two luminous windows  saw 
spirits moving musically  

to a lutes  swell tuned law  
round about a throne where  sitting 

 porphyrogene    
in state his glory well befitting  

the ruler of the realm was seen  

and all with pearl and ruby glowing 

was the fair palace door  
through which came flowing  flowing  flow  
ing 

and sparkling evermore  
a troop of echoes  whose sweet duty 

was but to sing  
in voices of surpassing beauty  

the wit and wisdom of their king  

but evil things  in robes of sorrow  

assailed the monarch s high estate  
 ah  let us mourn   for never morrow 

shall dawn upon him desolate   
and round about his home the glory 

that blushed and bloomed  
is but a dim remembered story 

of the old time entombed  

and travelers  now  within that valley  
through the red litten windows see 



poe s poems      

vast forms  that move fantastically 

to the discordant melody  
while  like a ghastly rapid river  

through the pale door 
a hideous throng rush out forever 

and laugh but smile no more  

the conqueror worm  

lo   tis a gala night 

within the lonesome latter years  
an angel throng  bewinged  bedight 

in veils  and drowned in tears  
sit in a theater  to see 

a play of hopes and fears  
while the orchestra breathes fitfully 

the music of the spheres  

mimes  in the form of god on high  

mutter and mumble low  
and hither and thither fly 

mere puppets they  who come and go 
at bidding of vast formless things 

that shift the scenery to and fro  
flapping from out their condor wings 

invisible woe  

that motely drama oh  be sure 

it shall not be forgot   
with its phantom chased for evermore  

by a crowd that seize it not  
through a circle that ever returneth in 

to the self same spot  
and much of madness  and more of sin 

and horror the soul of the plot  



    poe s poems  

but see  amid the mimic rout 

a crawling shape intrude   
a blood red thing that writhes from out 

the scenic solitude   
it writhes  it writhes  with mortal pangs 

the mimes become its food  
and the angels sob at vermin fangs 

in human gore imbued  

out out are the lights out all  

and  over each quivering form  
the curtain  a funeral pall  

comes down with the rush of a storm  
and the angels  all pallid and wan  

uprising  unveiling  affirm 
that the play is the tragedy   man   

and its hero the conqueror worm  

to f s s  o d  

thou wouldst be loved  then let thy heart 

from its present pathway part not   
being everything which now thou art  

be nothing which thou art not  
so with the world thy gentle ways  

thy grace  thy more than beauty  
shall be an endless theme of praise  

and love a simple duty  

to one in paradise  

thou wast that all to me  love  
for which my soul did pine 

a green isle in the sea  love  
a fountain and a shrine

all wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers  
and all the flowers were mine  

ah  dream too bright to last  

ah  starry hope   that didst arise 
but to be overcast  

a voice from out the future cries  
 on  on   but o er the past 

 dim gulf   my spirit hovering lies 
mute  motionless  aghast  

for  alas  alas  with me 

the light of life is o er  
 no more no more no more    

 such language holds the solemn sea 
to the sands upon the shore  

shall bloom the thunder blasted tree  
or the stricken eagle soar  

and all my days are trances  

and all my nightly dreams 
are where thy dark eye glances  

and where thy footstep gleams 
in what ethereal dances  

by what eternal streams  

the valley of unrest  

once it smiled a silent dell 
where the people did not dwell  
they had gone unto the wars  
trusting to the mild eyed stars  
nightly  from their azure towers  
to keep watch above the flowers  
in the midst of which all day 



    poe s poems  

the red sun light lazily lay     

now each visitor shall confess 

the sad valley s restlessness  

nothing there is motionless    

nothing save the airs that brood 

over the magic solitude  

ah  by no wind are stirred those trees 

that palpitate like the chill seas 

around the misty hebrides  

ah  by no wind those clouds are driven 

that rustle through the unquiet heaven 

uneasily  from morn till even  

over the violets there that lie 

in myriad types of the human eye 

over the lilies there that wave 

and weep above a nameless grave  

they wave   from out their fragrant tops 

eternal dews come down in drops  

they weep  from off their delicate stems 

perennial tears descend in gems  

the city in the sea  

lo  death has reared himself a throne 

in a strange city lying alone 

far down within the dim west  

where the good and the bad and the worst 

and the best 

have gone to their eternal rest  
their shrines and palaces and towers 
 time eaten towers that tremble not    
resemble nothing that is ours  
around  by lifting winds forgot  



foe s poems      

resignedly beneath the sky 
the melancholy waters lie  

no rays from the holy heaven come down 
on the long night time of that town  
but light from out the lurid sea 
streams up the turrets silently 
gleams up the pinnacles far and free 
up domes up spires up kingly halls 
up fanes up babylon like walls 
up shadowy long  forgotten bowers 
of sculptured ivy and stone flowers 
up many and many a marvelous shrine 
whose wreathed friezes intertwine 
the viol  the violet  and the vine  
resignedly beneath the sky 
the melancholy waters lie  
so blend the turrets and shadows there 
that all seem pendulous in air  
while from a proud tower in the town 
death looks gigantically down  

there open fanes and gaping graves 
yawn level with the luminous waves 
but not the riches there that lie 
in each idol s diamond eye 
not the gayly jeweled dead 
tempt the waters from their bed  
for no ripples curl  alas  
along that wilderness of glass 
no swellings tell that winds may be 
upon some far off happier sea 
no heavings hint that winds have been 
on seas less hideously serene  



    poe s poems  

but lo  a stir is in the air   
the wave there is a movement there  
as if the towers had thrust aside  
in slightly sinking  the dull tide 
as if their tops had feebly given 
a void within the filmy heaven  
the waves have now a redder glow  
the hours are breathing faint and low 
and when  amid no earthly moans  
down  down that town shall settle hence  
hell  rising from a thousand thrones  
shall do it reverence  

the sleeper  

at midnight  in the month of june  
i stand beneath the mystic moon  
an opiate vapor  dewy  dim  
exhales from out her golden rim  
and  softly dripping  drop by drop  
upon the quiet mountain top  
steals drowsily and musically 
into the universal valley  
the rosemary nods upon the grave   
the lily lolls upon the wave   
wrapping the fog about its breast  
the ruin molders into rest   
looking like lethe  see  the lake 
a conscious slumber seems to take  
and would not  for the world  awake  
all beauty sleeps   and lo   where lies 
her casement open to the skies  
irene  with her destinies

oh  lady bright   can it be right 
this window open to the night  
the wanton airs  from the tree top  
laughingly through the lattice drop 
the bodiless airs  a wizard rout  
flit through thy chamber in and out 
and wave the curtain canopy 
so fitfully so fearfully  
above the closed and fringed lid 
 neath which thy slumb ring soul lies hid 
that  o er the floor and down the wall  
like ghosts the shadows rise and fall   
oh  lady dear  hast thou no fear  
why and what art thou dreaming here  
sure thou art come o er far off seas  
a wonder to these garden trees  
strange is thy pallor  strange thy dress  
strange  above all  thy length of tress  
and this all solemn silentness  

the lady sleeps  oh  may her sleep  
which is enduring  so be deep   
heaven have her in its sacred keep 
this chamber changed for one more holy  
this bed for one more melancholy  
i pray to god that she may lie 
forever with unopened eye  
while the dim sheeted ghosts go by   

my love  she sleeps  oh  may her sleep  

as it is lasting  so be deep  

soft may the worms about her creep  

far in the forest  dim and old  

for her may some tall vault unfold 



    poe s poems  

some vault that oft hath flung its black 
and winged pannels fluttering back  
triumphant  o er the crested palls  
of her grand family funerals 
some sepulcher  remote  alone  
against whose portal she hath thrown  
in childhood  many an idle stone 
some tomb from out whose sounding door 
she ne er shall force an echo more  
thrilling to think  poor child of sin 
it was the dead who groaned within  

silence  

there are some qualities some incorporate 

things  

that have a double life  which thus is made 
a type of that twin entity which springs 
from matter and light  evinced in solid and 

shade  

there is a two fold silence sea and shore 
body and soul  one dwells in lonely places  
newly with grass o ergrown  some solemn 

graces  

some human memories and tearful lore  
render him terrorless  his name s  no more   
he is the corporate silence  dread him not  

no power hath he of evil in himself  
but should some urgent tate  untimely lot   

bring thee to meet his shadow  nameless elf

take this kiss upon the brow   

and  in parting from you now  

thus much let me avow 

you are not wrong  who deem 

that my days have been a dream  

yet if hope has flown away 

in a night  or in a day  

in a vision  or in none  

is it therefore the less gone  

all that we see or seem 

is but a dream within a dream  

i stand amid the roar 
of a surf  tormented shore  
and i hold with my hand 
grains of the golden sand 
how few   yet how they creep 
through my ringers to the deep  
while i weep while i weep  
o god  can i not grasp 
them with a tighter clasp  
o god   can i not save 
one from the pitiless wave  
is all that we see or seem 
but a dream within a dream

haunted by ill angels only

from an ultimate dim thule 
from a wild weird clime that lieth  sublime 
out of space out of time  

bottomless vales and boundless floods  
and chasms  and caves  and titan woods  
with forms that no man can discover 
for the dews that drip all over  
mountains toppling evermore 
into seas without a shore  
seas that restlessly aspire  
surging  unto skies of fire   
lakes that endlessly outspread 
their lone waters lone and dead  
their still waters still and chilly 
with the snows of the lolling lily  

by the lakes that thus outspread 
their lone waters  lone and dead 
their sad waters  sad and chilly 
with the snows of the lolling lily  
by the mountains near the river 
murmuring lowly  murmuring ever  
by the gray woods  by the swamp 
where the toad and the newt encamp  
by the dismal tarns and pools 
where dwell the ghouls 
by each spot the most unholy 
in each nook most melancholy  
there the traveler meets aghast 
sheeted memories of the past 
shrouded forms that start and sigh 
as they pass the wanderer by 
 white robed forms of friends long given  
in agony  to the earth and heaven  



poe s poems      

for the heart whose woes are legion 

 tis a peaceful  soothing region 

for the spirit that walks in shadow 

 tis oh  tis an eldorado  

but the traveler  traveling through it  

may not dare not openly view it  

never its mysteries are exposed 

to the weak human eye unclosed   

so wills its king  who hath forbid 

the uplifting of the fringed lid   

and thus the sad soul that here passes 

beholds it but through darkened glasses  

by a route obscure and lonely  

haunted by ill angels only  

where an eidolon  named night  

on a black throne reigns upright  

i have wandered home but newly 

from this ultimate dim thule  

to zante  

fair isle  that from the fairest of all flowers  

thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take  
how many memories of what radiant hours 

at sight of thee and thine at once awake   
how many scenes of what departed bliss   

how many thoughts of what entombed 

hopes   
how many visions of a maiden that is 

no more no more upon thy verdant slopes  
no more   alas  that magical sad sound 

transforming all  thy charms shall please 

no more   
thy memory no more   accursed ground

henceforth i hold thy flower enameled shore  
o hyacinthine isle   o purple zante   
 isola d oro  fior di levantea

i dwelt alone 
in a world of moan  
and my soul was a stagnant tide  
till the fair and gentle eulalie became my 

blushing bride 

till the yellow haired young eulalie became 
my smiling bride  

ah  less less bright 
the stars of the night 
than the eyes of the radiant gill  
and never a flake 
that the vapor can make 
with the moon tints of purpie and 

pearl  

can vie with the modest eulalie  s most unre  
garded curl

eldorado  

gaily bedight  

a gallant knight  
in sunshine and in shadow  

had journeyed long  

singing a song  
in search of eldorado  

but he grew old 

this knight so bold 
and o er his heart a shadow 

fell as he found 

no spot of ground 
that looked like eldorado  

and  as his strength 

failed him at length  
he met a pilgrim shadow

   where can it be

of the moon

tottering above 

in her highest noon  

the enamored moon 
blushes with love

 with the rapid pleiads  even  

which were seven

is owing to that lyre 

by which he sits and sings 

the trembling living wire 
of those unusual strings  

but the skies that angels trod  
where deep thoughts are a duty 

where love s a grown up god 
where the houri glances are 

imbued with all the beauty 
which we worship in a star

thank heaven   the crisis 

the danger is past  
and the lingering illness 

is over at last 
and the fever called  living

i am shorn of my strength  
and no muscle i move

but no matter  i feel 
i am better at length  

and i rest so composed  
now  in my bed  
that any beholder 

might fancy me dead 
might start at beholding me  
thinking me dead  

the moaning and groaning  
the sighing and sobbing  

are quieted now  

with that horrible throbbing 

at heart   ah  that horrible  
horrible throbbing  

the sickness the nausea 

the pitiless pain 
have ceased  with the fever 

that maddened my brain 
with the fever called    living  

that burned in my brain  

and oh   of all tortures 

that torture the worst 
has abated the terrible 

torture of thirst 
for the naphthaline river

from a spring but a very few 

feet under ground 
from a cavern not very far 

down under ground  

and ah   let it never 

be foolishly said 
that my room it is gloomy 

and narrow my bed   
for man never slept 

in a different bed 
and  to sleep  you must slumber 

in just such a bed  

my tantalized spirit 

here blandly reposes  
forgetting  or never 

regretting its roses  
its old agitations 

of myrtles and roses  

for now  while so quietly 

lying  it fancies 
a holier odor 

about it  of pansies 
a rosemary odor  

commingled with pansies 
with rue and the beautiful 

puritan pansies  

and so it lies happily  

bathing in many 
a dream of the truth 

and the beauty of annie 



    poe s poems  

drowned in a bath 
of the tresses of annie  

she tenderly kissed me  

she fondly caressed  
and then i fell gently 

to sleep on her breast 
deeply to sleep 

from the heaven of her breast  

when the light was extinguished  

she covered me warm 
and she prayed to the angels 

to keep me from harm 
to the queen of the angels 

to shield me from harm  

and i lie so composedly  

now  in my bed  
 knowing her love  

that you fancy me dead 
and i rest so contentedly  

now in my bed  
 with her love at my breast  

that you fancy me dead 
that you shudder to look at me  

thinking me dead  

but my heart it is brighter 

than all of the many 
stars in the sky  

for it sparkles with annie 
it glows with the light 

of the love of my annie 
with the thought ot the light 

of the eyes of my annie

to   

i heed not that my earthly lot 

hath little of earth in it 
that years of love have been forgot 

in the hatred of a minute   
i mourn not that the desolate 

are happier  sweet  than i  
but that you sorrow for my fate 

who am a passer by  

bridal ballad  

the ring is on my hand  

and the wreath is on my brow  

satins and jewels grand 

are all at my command  
and i am happy now  

and my lord he loves me well   

but  when first he breathed his vow  
i felt my bosom swell 
for the words rang as a knell  
and the voice seemed his who fell 
in the battle down the dell  

and who is happy now  

but he spoke to re assure me  

and he kissed my pallid brow  
while a reverie came o er me  
and to the church yard bore me  
and i sighed to him before me  
thinking him dead d elormie  
 oh  i am happy now   



    foe s poems  

and thus the words were spoken  

and this the plighted vow  
and  though my faith be broken  
and  though my heart be broken  
behold the golden token 
that proves me happy now   

would god i could awaken  

for i dream i know not how  
and my soul is sorely shaken 
lest an evil step be taken  
lest the dead who is forsaken 

may not be happy now  






beloved   amid the earnest woes 

that crowd around my earthly path 

 drear path  alas   where grows 

not even one lonely rose  
my soul at least a solace hath 

in dreams of thee  and therein knows 

an eden of bland repose  

and thus thy memory is to me 
like some enchanted far off isle 

in some tumultuous sea 

some ocean throbbing far and free 
with storms but where meanwhile 

serenest skies continually 

just o er that one bright island smile

beneath the cold moon 
as the spell which no slumber 

of witchery may test  
the rhythmical number 

which lull d him to rest   

spirits in wings  and angels to the view  

a thousand seraphs burst th  empyrean thro   

young dreams still hovering on their drowsy 

flight  
seraphs in all but   knowledge   the keen 

light 

that fell  refracted  thro  thy bounds  afar  
o death  from eye of god upon that star  
sweet was that error sweeter still that 

death 

sweet was that error e en with us the breath 
of science dims the mirror of our joy 
to them  twere the simoon  and would 

destroy  

for what  to them  availeth it to know 
that truth is falsehood or that bliss is woe

with the last ecstasy of satiate life 
beyond that death no immortality

but sleep that pondereth and is not  to be   
and there oh  may my weary spirit dwell 
apart from heaven s eternity and yet how 

far from hell  

what guilty spirit  in what shrubbery dim  
heard not the stirring summons of that hymn  
but two  they fell for heaven no grace 

imparts 

to those who hear not for their beating hearts  
a maiden angel and her seraph lover 
o  where  and ye may seek the wide skies 

over  

was love  the blind  near sober duty known  
unguided love hath fallen  mid  tears of 

perfect moan   

he was a goodly spirit he who fell   
a wanderer by mossy mantled well 
a gazer on the lights that shine above 
a dreamer in the moonbeam  by his love  
what wonder  for each star is eye like there  
and looks so sweetly down on beauty s hair  
and they  and ev ry mossy spring were holy 
to his love haunted heart and melancholy  
the night had found  to him a night of woe  
upon a mountain crag  young angelo 
beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky  
and scowls on starry worlds that down be  
neath it lie  

here sate he with his love his dark eye bent 
with eagle gaze along the firmament  
now turned it upon her but ever then 
it trembled to the orb of earth again

  ian the  dearest  see  how dim that ray  
how lovely  tis to look so far away  
she seemed not thus upon that autumn eve 
i left her gorgeous halls nor mourned to 

leave  

that eve that eve i should remember well 
the sun ray dropped  in lemnos  with a spell 
on th  arabesque carving of a gilded hall 
wherein i sate  and on the draperied wall 
and on my eyelids o the heavy light  
how drowsily it weighed them into night  
on flowers  before  and mist  and love they 

ran 

with persian saadi in his gulistan  
but o that light  i slumber  d death  the 

while  

stole o er my senses in that lovely isle 
so softly that no single silken hair 
awoke that slept or knew that he was there  

 the last spot of earth s orb i trod upon 
was a proud temple call d the parthenon  
more beauty clung around her column d wall 
than ev n thy glowing bosoms beats withal  
and when old time my wing did disenthral 
thence sprang i as the eagle from his tower  
and years i left behind me in an hour  
what time upon her airy bounds i hung  
one half the garden of her globe was flung  
unrolling as a chart unto my view 
tenantless cities of the desert too  
lanthe  beauty crowded on me then  
and half i wished to be again of men   
   my angelo  and why of them to be  



poe s poems      

a brighter dwelling place is here for thee  
and greener fields than in yon world above  
and woman s loveliness and passionate love    

   but  list  ian the  when the air so soft 
fail d  as my pennon d spirit leapt aloft  
perhaps my brain grew dizzy but the world 
i left so late was into chaos hurl d 
sprang from her station  on the winds apart  
and roll d  a flame  the fiery heaven athwart  
methought  my sweet one  then i ceased to 

soar 

and fell not so swiftly as i rose before  
but with a downward  tremulous motion thro  
light  brazen rays  this golden star unto  
nor long the measure of my falling hours  
for nearest of all stars was thine to ours 
dread star  that came  amid a night of mirth 
a red dsedalion on the timid earth  

 we came and to thy earth but not to us 
be given our lady s bidding to discuss  
we came  my love   around  above  below  
gay fire fly of the night we come and go  
nor ask a reason save the angel nod 
she grants to us  as granted by her god  
but  angelo  than thine gray time unfurl d 
never his fairy wing o er fairer world  
dim was its little disk and angel eyes 
alone could see the phantom in the skies  
when first al aaraaf knew her course to be 
headlong thitherward o er the starry sea 
but when its glory swell d upon the sky  
as glowing beauty s bust beneath man s eye  



    poe s poems  

we paused before the heritage of men  
and thy star trembled as doth beauty then   
thus  in discourse  the lovers whiled away 
the night that waned and waned and brought 

no day  

they fell   for heaven to them no hope im  
parts 
who hear not for the beating of their hearts  

i to the river   

fair river  in thy bright  clear flow 
of crystal  wandering water  

thou art an emblem of the glow 

of beauty the unhidden heart 
the playful maziness of art 

in old alberto s daughter  

but when within thy wave she looks 

which glistens then  and trembles 
why  then  the prettiest of books 

her worshiper resembles  
for in his heart  as in thy stream  

her image deeply lies 
his heart which trembles at the beam 

of her soul searching eyes  

tamerlane  

kind solace in a dying hour  

such  father  is not  now  my theme   

i will not madly deem that power 

of earth may shrive me of the sin 
unearthly pride hath revel d in 



poe s poems      

i have no time to dote or dream  
you call it hope that fire of fire  
it is but agony of desire   
if i can hope oh  god  i can 

its fount is holier more divine 
i would not call thee fool  old man  

but such is not a gift of thine  

know thou the secret of a spirit 

bow d from its wild pride into shame  

o yearning heart  i did inherit 

thy withering portion with the fame  

the searing glory which hath shone 

amid the jewels of my throne  

halo of hell  and with a pain 

not hell shall make me fear again 

craving heart  for the lost flowers 
and sunshine of my summer hours  
the undying voice of that dead time  
with its interminable chime  
rings  in the spirit of a spell  

upon thy emptiness a knell  

  have not  always been as now   
the fever d diadem on my brow 

i claim d and won usurpingly 
hath not the same fierce heirdom given 
rome to caesar this to me  

the heritage of a kingly mind  
and a proud spirit which hath striven 
triumphantly with human kind  

on mountain soil i first drew life  
the mists of the taglay have shed 
nightly the dews upon my head  



    poe s poems  

and  i believe  the winged strife 
and tumult of the headlong air 
have nestled in my very hair  

so late from heaven that dew it fell 

  mid dreams of an unholy night  
upon me with the touch of hell  

while the red flashing of the light 
from clouds that hung like banners  o er  

appeared to my half closing eye 

the pageantry of monarchy  
and the deep trumpet thunder s roar 
came hurriedly upon me  telling 

of human battle  where my voice  
my own voice  silly child  was swelling 

 o   how my spirit would rejoice  
and leap within me at the cry  
the battle cry of victory  

the rain came down upon my head 
unshelter d and the heavy wind 
rendered me mad and deaf and blind  

it was but man  i thought  who shed 
laurels upon me   and tho rush 

the torrent of the chilly air 

gurgled within my ear the crush 
of empires with the captive s prayer 

the hum of suitors and the tone 

of flattery  round a sovereign s throne  

my passions  from that hapless hour  

usurped a tyranny which men 
have deem d  since i have reached to power  
my innate nature be it so   



poe s poems      

but  father  there liv d one who  then  
then in my boyhood when their fire 

burn d with a still intenser glow 
 for passion must  with youth  expire  
e en then who knew this iron heart 
in woman s weakness had a part  

i have no words alas to tell 
the loveliness of loving well   
nor would i now attempt to trace 
the more than beauty of a face 
whose lineaments  upon my mind  

are shadows on th  unstable wind  

thus i remember having dwelt 

some page of early lore upon  
with loitering eye  till i have felt 
the letters with their meaning melt 

to fantasies with none  

o  she was worthy of all love   

love as in infancy was mine 
 twas such as angel minds above 

might envy  her young heart the shrine 
on which my every hope and thought 

were incense then a goodly gift  

for they were childish and upright 
pure as her young example taught  

why did i leave it  and  adrift  
trust to the fire within  for light  

we grew an age and love together 
roaming the forest  and the wild  

my breast her shield in wintry weather  
and  when the friendly sunshine smil d 



    foe s poems  

and she would mark the opening skies  
i saw no heaven but in her eyes  
young love s first lesson is the heart  

for  mid that sunshine  and those smiles  
when  from our little cares apart  

and laughing at her girlish wiles  
i d throw me on her throbbing breast  

and pour my spirit out in tears 
there was no need to speak the rest 

no need to quiet any fears 
of her who asked no reason why  
but turned on me her quiet eye  

yet more than worthy of the love 

my spirit struggled with  and strove  

when  on the mountain peak alone  

ambition lent it a new tone 

i had no being but in thee   

  the world  and all it did contain 

in the earth the air the sea 

its joy its little lot of pain 
that was new pleasure the ideal  

dim  vanities of dreams by night 
and dimmer nothings which were real 

 shadows and a more shadowy light   
parted upon their misty wings  
and  so  confusedly  became 
thine image and a name a name  
two separate yet most intimate things  

i was ambitious have you known 

the passion  father  you have not  
a cottager  i mark d a throne 
of half the world as all my own  



poe s poems      

and murmur d at suoh lowly lot 
but  just like any other dream  

upon the vapor of the dew 
my own had past  did not the beam 

of beauty which did while it thro  
the minute the hour the day oppress 
my mind with double loveliness 
we walk d together on the crown 
of a high mountain which look d down 
afar from its proud natural towers 
of rock and forest  on the hills 
the dwindled hills  begirt with bowers 
and shouting with a thousand rills  

i spoke to her of power and pride  

but mystically in such guise 
that she might deem it nought beside 

the moment s converse  in her eyes 
i read  perhaps too carelessly 

a mingled feeling with my own 
the flush on her bright cheek  to me 

seem d to become a queenly throne 
too well that i should let it be 

light in the wilderness alone  

i wrapp d myself in grandeur then 

and donn d a visionary crown 
yet it was not that fantasy 

had thrown her mantle over me 
but that  among the rabble men  

lion ambition is chain d down 
and crouches to a keeper s hand 

not so in deserts where the grand 



    poe s poems  

the wild the terrible conspire 
with their own breath to fan his fire  

look  round thee now on samarcand   

is she not queen of earth  her pride 
above all cities  in her hand 

their destinies  in all beside 
of glory which the world hath known 

stands she not nobly and alone  
falling her veriest stepping stone 

shall form the pedestal of a throne 
and who her sovereign  timour he 
whom the astonished people saw 
striding o er empires haughtily 

a diadem d outlaw  

o  human love  thou spirit given  
on earth  of all we hope in heaven  
which fall st into the soul like rain 
upon the siroc wither d plain  
and  falling in thy power to bless  
but leav st the heart a wilderness  
idea  which bindest life around 
with music of so strange a sound 
and beauty of so wild a birth 
farewell  for i have won the earth  

when hope  the eagle that tower d  could see 

no cliff beyond him in the sky  
his pinions were bent droopingly 

and homeward turn d his soften d eye  
 twas sunset  when the sun will part 
there comes a sullenness of heart 
to him who still would look upon 



poe s poems      

the glory of the summer sun  

that soul will hate the ev ning mist 

so often lovely  and will list 

to the sound of the coming darkness  known 

to those whose spirits hearken  as one 
who  in a dream of night  would fly 
but cannot from a danger nigh  

what tho  the moon the white moon 
shed all the splendor of her noon  
her smile is chilly and her beam  
in that time of dreariness  will seem 
 so like you gather in your breath  
a portrait taken after death  
and boyhood is a summer sun 
whose waning is the dreariest one 
for all we live to know is known 
and all we seek to keep hath flown 
let life  then  as the day flower  fall 
with the noon day beauty which is all  

i reach  d my home my home no more 
for all had flown who made it so  
i pass d from out its mossy door  
and  tho  my tread was soft and low  
a voice came from the threshold stone 
of one whom i had earlier known 

o  i defy thee  hell  to show 
on beds of fire that burn below  

an humbler heart a deeper woe  

father  i firmly do believe 

i know for death who comes for me 
from regions of the blest afar  



    poe s poems  

where there is nothing to deceive  
hath left his iron gate ajar  

and rays of truth you cannot see 

are flashing thro  eternity 
i do believe that eblis hath 
a snare in every human path  
else how  when in the holy grove 
i wandered  of the idol  love  
who daily scents his snowy wings 
with incense of burnt offerings 
from the most unpolluted things  
whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven 
above with trellis d rays from heaven 
no mote may shun no tiniest fly 
the light ning of his eagle eye 
how was it that ambition crept  

unseen  amid the revels there  
till growing bold  he laughed and leapt 

in the tangles of love s very hair  

to   

the bowers whereat  in dreams  i see 

the wantonest singing birds  
are lips and all thy melody 

of lip begotten words 

thine eyes  in heaven of heart enshrined 

then desolately fall  
god   on my funereal mind 

like starlight on a pall 

thy heart thy heart  i wake and sigh  
and sleep to dream till day 



poe s poems      

of the truth that gold can never buy 
of the baubles that it may  

a dream  

in visions of the dark night 

i have dreamed of joy departed 

but a waking dream of  life and light 
hath left me broken hearted  

ah   what is not a dream by day 

to him whose eyes are cast 
on things around him with a ray 

turned back upon the past  

that holy dream that holy dream  
while all the world were chiding  

hath cheered me as a lovely beam 
a lonely spirit guiding  

what though that light  thro  storm and night  

so trembled from afar 
what could there be more purely bright 

in truth s day star  

romance  

romance  who loves to nod and sing  
with drowsy head and folded wing  
among the green leaves as they shake 
far down within some shadowy lake  
to me a painted paroquet 
hath been a most familiar bird 
taught me my alphabet to say 



    poe s poems  

to lisp my very earliest word  
while to the wild wood i did lie 
a child with a most knowing eye  

of late  eternal condor years 
so shake the very heaven on high 
with tumult as they thunder by  
i have no time for idle cares 
through gazing on the unquiet sky  
and when an hour with calmer wings 
its down upon my spirit flings 
that little time with lyre and rhyme 
to while away forbidden things  
my heart would feel to be a crime 
unless it trembled with the strings  

fairyland  

dim vales and shadowy floods 
and cloudy looking woods  
whose forms we can t discover 
for the tears that drip all over   
huge moons there wax and wane 
again again again 
every moment of the night 
forever changing places  
and they put out the star light 
with the breath from their pale faces  
about twelve by the moon  dial 
one more filmy than the rest 
 a kind which  upon trial  
they have found to be the best  
comes down still down and down 
with its center on the crown 



poe s poems      

of a mountain s eminence  

while its wide circumference 

in easy drapery falls 

over hamlets  over halls  

wherever they may be 

o er the strange woods o er the sea 

over spirits on the wing 

over every drowsy thing 

and buries them up quite 

in a labyrinth of light 

and then  how deep  o  deep 

is the passion of their sleep  

in the morning they arise  

and their moony covering 

is soaring in the skies  

with the tempests as they toss 

like almost any thing 

or a yellow albatross  
they use that moon no more 
for the same end as before 
videlicet a tent 
which i think extravagant  
its atomies  however  
into a shower dissever  
of which those butterflies 
of earth  who seek the skies  
and so come down again 
 never contented things   
have brought a specimen 
upon their quivering wings  



    poe s poems  

the lake  to   

in spring of youth it was my lot 

to haunt of the wide world a spot 

the which i could not love the less 

so lovely was the loneliness 

of a wild lake  with black rock bound  

and the tall pines that towered around  

but when the night had thrown her pall 

upon that spot  as upon all  

and the mystic wind went by 

murmuring in melody 

then ah  then  i would awake 

to the terror of a lone lake  

yet the terror was not fright  

but a tremulous delight 

a feeling not the jeweled mine 

could teach or bribe me to define 

nor love although the love were thine  

death was in that poisonous wave  

and in its gulf a fitting grave 

for him who thence could solace bring 

to his lone imagining 

whose solitary soul could make 

an eden of that dim lake  

song  

t saw thee on thy bridal day 

when a burning blush came o er thee  
through happiness around thee lay  

the world all love before thee  



poe s poems      

and thine eye a kindling light 

 whatever it might be  
was all on earth my aching sight 

ot loveliness could see  

that blush  perhaps  was maiden shame 

as such it well may pass 
though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame 

in the breast of him  alas  

who saw thee on that bridal day  

when that deep blush would come o er thee  
though happiness around thee lay  

the world all love before thee  



to m  l  s    

of all who hail thy presence as the morning 
of all to whom thine absence is the night 
the blotting utterly from out high heaven 
the sacred sun of all who  weeping  bless thee 
hourly for hope for life ah   above all  
for the resurrection of deep buried faith  
in truth in virtue in humanity 
of all who  on despair s unhallowed bed 
lying down to die  have suddenly arisen 
at thy soft murmured words   let there be 

light   

at the soft murmured words that were fulfilled 
in the seraphic glancing of thine eyes 
of all who owe thee most whose gratitude 
nearest resembles worship oh  remember 
the truest the most fervently devoted  



    foe s poems  

and think that these weak lines are written by 

him 

by him who  as he pens them  thrills to think 
his spirit is communing with an angel s  

spirit of the dead  

thy soul shall find itself alone 

 mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone   

not one  of all the crowd  to pry 

into thine hour of secrecy  

be silent in thy solitude 
which is not loneliness for then 

the spirits of the dead who stood 
in life before thee are again 

in death around thee and their will 

shall overshadow thee  be still  

the night tho  clear shall frown 
and the stars shall not look down 
from their high thrones in the heaven  
with light like hope to mortals given 
but their red orbs  without beam  
to thy weariness shall seem 
asa burning and a fever 
which would cling to thee forever  

now are thoughts thou shalt not banish  
now are visions ne er to vanish 
from thy spirit shall they pass 
no more like dew drops from the grass  

the breeze the breath of god is stlil 
and the mist upon the hill 



poe s poems      

sahdowy shadowy yet unbroken  

is a symbol and a token 

how it hangs upon the trees    

a mystery of mysteries            

to helen  

helen  thy beauty is to me 

like those nicean barks of yore  
that gently  o er a perfumed sea  

the weary  way  worn wanderer bore 

to his own native shore  

on desperate seas long wont to roam    

thy hyacinth hair  thy classic face  
thy naiad airs have brought me home 

to the glory that was greece 
and the grandeur that was rome  

lo  in yon brilliant window niche 
how statue like i see thee stand  
the agate lamp within thy hand  

ah   pysche  from the regions which   

are holy land  

alone  

prom childhood s hour i have not been 
as others were i have not seen 
as others saw i could not bring 
my passions from a common spring  
from the same source i have not taken 
my sorrow  i could not awaken 
my heart to joy at the same tone   
and all i lov d  i lov d alone  



    poe s poems  

then in my childhood in the dawn 
of a most stormy life was drawn 
from ev ry depth of good and ill 
the mystery which binds me still  
from the torrent  or the fountain  
from the red cliff of the mountain  
from the sun that  round me roll d 
in its autumn tint of gold 
from the lightning in the sky 
as it pass d me flying by 
from the thunder and the storm  
and the cloud that took the form 
 when the rest of heaven was blue  
of a demon in my view  

the end
